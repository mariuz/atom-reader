First they <a href=\"http://blog.lizardwrangler.com/2012/07/06/thunderbird-stability-and-community-innovation/\">killed off the development of Thunderbird</a> because, as we all know, people mainly use webmail these days. Then they presented us their view that the big Certificate Authorities are <i>too big to fail</i>, as CAs gravely violated our trust (c.f. <a href=\"http://lwn.net/Articles/480279/\">Trustwave and their MitM authority</a>). And \"now\" <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=600919\">they're also blocking the introduction of new formats</a> into their browser because they cannot be the one who innovates. Instead Microsoft and Apple obviously need to take the lead in introducing a format into their browsers because otherwise it wouldn't be useful. Even though it's safe to say that Chrome and Firefox make up for more than half of the desktop browser market share. It might be that Chrome's nibbling from Firefox's, still IE seems to be in decline and Safari is rather a further mention than something many people would care strongly about.<br>\n<br>\nThere were of course some valid reasons for not supporting WebP yet. But most of them got fixed in the meantime and all we hear is the referal to proprietary vendors who need to move first. If I'd want to depend on such vendors I'd go with proprietary operating systems. (Having to deal with hardware products of proprietary vendors at $dayjob is enough.) So what's up Mozilla? The solution is to ignore your users and tag bugs with patches <i>wontfix</i>?<br>\n<br>\nThe only real advantage of Firefox over Chromium these days is the vast amount of plugins and extensions (e.g. <a href=\"http://5digits.org/pentadactyl/\">Pentadactyl</a>, for which there is no real equivalent available). Another sad fact is that you need to pull Firefox from a 3rd party repository (even though packages are coming from the 2nd party) to get a current version onto your Debian system to work with the web. But then it's not Mozilla who's to blame here. Maybe we should've introduced one Iceweasel version that's allowed to have reverse-dependencies and one that cannot.<br>\n<br>\n(This post might contain hyberboles, which should be considered as such.)"

It felt a bit excessive to send an email to debian-devel for just one RC bug.</p>\n<br>  <a href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/nthykier.wordpress.com/210/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/nthykier.wordpress.com/210/\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></a>"

Ce trebuie să facem ?</b><br><div align=\"justify\"><br></div><div align=\"justify\">Tradițional, <a href=\"http://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_proprietar\">software-ul proprietar</a> este asociat cu răul tratament aplicat utilizatorilor: plantarea de <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_surveillance\">programe de supraveghere</a>, limitări impuse prin „cătușe digitale” cum ar fi <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management\">DRM</a> (supranumit <a href=\"http://www.defectivebydesign.org/what_is_drm_digital_restrictions_management\">„Digital Restrictions Management”</a>) și <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backdoor_%28computing%29\">portițe ascunse</a>, care fac posibile acțiuni dăunătoare, întreprinse prin control de la distanță asupra calculatorului. Programele care permit toate acestea sunt <a href=\"http://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_r%C4%83u_inten%C8%9Bionat\">programe rău-intenționate</a> (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware\"><i>malware</i></a>) și trebuie tratate ca atare.  Exemple arhicunoscute includ Windows, <a href=\"http://www.defectivebydesign.org/5-reasons-to-avoid-iphone-3g\">iProdusele Apple</a> și <a href=\"http://www.defectivebydesign.org/blog/1097\">„incendiatorul” de cărți virtuale AmazonKindle</a> [1], care se fac vinovate de toate cele trei „păcate” enumerate; apoi Macintosh și <a href=\"http://www.defectivebydesign.org/sony\">PlayStation III</a>, care impun DRM; cele mai multe telefoane mobile, care ne spionează și oferă portițe ascunse în software; <a href=\"http://www.defectivebydesign.org/blog/1208\">Adobe Flash Player</a>, care spionează și impune DRM; în fine, multe aplicații pentru iProdusele Apple și <a href=\"http://www.defectivebydesign.org/amazon-android-drm\">Android</a>, care se fac vinovate de una sau mai multe dintre aceste practici reprobabile.</div><div align=\"justify\"><br></div><div align=\"justify\">Software-ul Liber oferă utilizatorilor șansa de a se apăra de acțiunile programelor rău-intenționate. Mai mult: de obicei, comunitatea îi protejează pe toți ceilalți; majoritatea utilizatorilor nu sunt obligați să miște nici un deget. Iată cum:</div><div align=\"justify\"><br></div><div align=\"justify\">Din când în când, programatorii descoperă că un program liber oarecare conține cod rău-intenționat. În general, ei publică imediat o versiune corectată a programului: fiindcă beneficiază de cele patru libertăți care definesc Software-ul Liber (vedeți <a href=\"http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.ro.html\">http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.ro.html</a>), ei pot să facă asta. Varianta modificată se cheamă un „fork” al programului în cauză. În scurt timp, comunitatea începe să utilizeze pe scară largă această variantă corectată, iar cea originală este abandonată. Perspectiva unui abandon nedemn nu este agreată de nici un autor de software; de aceea, chiar și cei care nu sunt animați de o moralitate foarte înaltă se abțin, totuși, să introducă cod rău-intenționat în programele libere.</div><div align=\"justify\"><br></div><div align=\"justify\">Dar asta nu se întâmplă întotdeauna. <a href=\"http://www.ubuntu.com/\">Ubuntu</a>, o <a href=\"http://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribu%C8%9Bie_Linux\">distribuție GNU/Linux</a> larg răspândită și care se bucură de o mare influență pe piață, a introdus un program de supraveghere în componența sa. Când un utilizator folosește desktop-ul Ubuntu pentru a căuta un cuvânt oarecare în fișierele aflate pe calculatorul său (deci, local), Ubuntu trimite acel cuvânt către unul dintre serverele Canonical (<a href=\"http://www.canonical.com/\">Canonical</a> este firma care dezvoltă Ubuntu).</div><div align=\"justify\"><br></div><div align=\"justify\">Acest mod de comportare este identic cu prima metodă de supraveghere despre care am aflat în Windows. Regretatul meu prieten Fravia mi-a atras atenția că, atunci când căuta un cuvânt în fișierele de pe sistemul lui Windows, acesta trimitea un pachet către un server oarecare, pachet care era detectat de către firewall. Pornind de la acest prim exemplu, am fost mai atent și am aflat despre tendința unor „reputate” programe proprietare de a se comporta ca programe rău-intenționate. Probabil, nu e nici o coincidență în faptul că Ubuntu expediază aceleași informații.</div><div align=\"justify\"><br></div><div align=\"justify\">Ubuntu folosește informația generată de căutări pentru a-i prezenta utilizatorului reclame care  să-l determine să cumpere diverse articole de la <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/\">Amazon</a>. Amazon comite multe fapte reprobabile (vedeți <a href=\"http://stallman.org/amazon.html\">http://stallman.org/amazon.html</a>); promovând Amazon, Canonical își aduce propria contribuție la acestea. Totuși, nu reclamele constituie fondul problemei. Fondul problemei îl constituie spionajul. Canonical ne asigură că nu le dezvăluie celor de la Amazon ce anume a căutat fiecare persoană. Totuși, colectarea datelor Dvs. personale de către Canonical este la fel de rea ca și cum ar face-o Amazon însuși.<br><br>Fără îndoială, oamenii vor crea o versiune modificată de Ubuntu, fără programe de supraveghere incluse. Unele distribuții GNU/Linux existente sunt, de fapt, versiuni modificate de Ubuntu. În momentul în care ele își vor actualiza baza provenită din Ubuntu, ajungând să folosească cea mai recentă versiune, mă aștept ca partea cu programele-spion să fie înlăturată. Și Canonical se așteaptă la asta.  <br><div align=\"justify\"><br>Cei mai mulți programatori vor abandona ideea de a dezvolta software pentru Ubuntu, fiind confruntați cu perspectiva trecerii în masă la o altă distribuție, corectată. Dar Canonical nu a renunțat la programele-spion. Probabil, Canonical crede că numele „Ubuntu” se bucură de o asemenea popularitate și influență pe piață, încât ar putea continua să le includă, scăpând, totuși, nesancționați.</div><div align=\"justify\"><br>Canonical susține că această funcție din Ubuntu realizează căutări pe Internet într-un mod diferit. În funcție de detaliile de implementare, faptul acesta ar ridica probleme mai mari sau nu, dar, în nici un caz, nu le-ar micșora.</div><div align=\"justify\"><br>Ubuntu permite utilizatorilor să dezactiveze programele-spion. E limpede, Canonical crede că mulți utilizatori Ubuntu le vor lăsa în starea implicită (activate). Și mulți fac, într-adevăr, asta, fiindcă nu înțeleg de ce ar trebui să încerce să corecteze ceva. De aceea, existența butonului de dezactivare nu face ca existența programelor-spion să devină acceptabilă.</div><div align=\"justify\"><br>Chiar dacă ar fi implicit dezactivată, funcția ar fi, totuși, periculoasă: cererea  „înscrieți-vă, odată pentru totdeauna”, atunci când riscurile depind de detalii, este o invitație la indolență. Pentru a proteja intimitatea utilizatorilor lor, sistemele trebuie să faciliteze o comportare prudentă: atunci când un program de căutare locală include și o funcție de căutare în rețea, folosirea acestei funcții trebuie să solicite acordul utilizatorului <i>de fiecare dată</i> când este apelată. Implementarea ar fi simplă: tot ce trebuie este să se separe butoanele pentru căutare locală și pentru căutare în rețea, așa cum făceau vechile versiuni de Ubuntu. O funcție de căutare în rețea trebuie, de asemenea, să îl informeze pe utilizator, limpede și la obiect, cine va primi acea informație personală despre el, în cazul în care alege să folosească funcția.</div><div align=\"justify\"><br>Dacă o parte semnificativă a formatorilor de opinie din comunitatea noastră privește problema doar în termeni personali, dezactivează programele-spion pe calculatoarele proprii și continuă să promoveze Ubuntu, Canonical poate scăpa fără să fie sancționată. Lucrul acesta ar fi o mare pierdere pentru comunitatea de Software Liber.</div><div align=\"justify\"><br>Noi, cei care prezentăm Software-ul Liber ca pe un mijloc de apărare împotriva programelor rău-intenționate, nu afirmăm că este infailibil. Nu se cunoaște nici un mijloc de apărare perfect. De aceea, contra-exemplul Ubuntu nu înseamnă că trebuie să ne retragem afirmațiile anterioare.</div><div align=\"justify\">Dar aici se pune în discuție mult mai mult decât simplul fapt că unii dintre noi ar trebui să ne retragem afirmațiile. Se pune în discuție dacă comunitatea noastră mai poate avea argumente împotriva programelor-spion proprietare. A spune „programele libere nu vă vor spiona, cu excepția Ubuntu” înseamnă mult mai puțin decât a spune, simplu, „programele libere nu vă vor spiona”.</div><div align=\"justify\"><br>Se cuvine ca noi înșine să le opunem celor de la Canonical suficientă critică, astfel încât să-i determinăm să înceteze practica arătată. Orice scuză oferită de Canonical este superfluă; chiar dacă ei ar folosi toți banii obținuți de la Amazon pentru a dezvolta programe libere, tot nu s-ar compensa pierderea suferită de Software-ul Liber, care ar înceta să mai fie un mijloc eficient de a preveni abuzul asupra utilizatorilor.</div><div align=\"justify\"><br>Dacă Dvs. recomandați sau distribuiți GNU/Linux, vă rugăm să scoateți Ubuntu din lista programelor avute în vedere. Dacă practica lor de a recomanda sau distribui programe nelibere nu v-a convins până acum, poate că, de data asta, o veți face. La întâlnirile de instalare GNU/Linux pe care le organizați, la evenimentele FLISOL [2], nu instalați și nu recomandați Ubuntu. În loc de asta, spuneți tuturor că Ubuntu a fost pus la izolare, fiindcă își spionează utilizatorii.</div><div align=\"justify\"><br>Odată cu asta, puteți spune oamenilor că Ubuntu conține programe nelibere și sugerează folosirea altor programe nelibere (vedeți <a href=\"http://www.gnu.org/distros/common-distros.html\">http://www.gnu.org/distros/common-distros.html</a>). Astfel, veți contracara cealaltă formă de influență negativă pe care Ubuntu o exercită în sânul comunității de Software Liber: legitimarea programelor nelibere.</div><div style=\"margin-top:0.42cm\"><span style=\"font-family:Liberation Sans,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:medium\"><b>Bibliografie:</b></span></span></div><div align=\"justify\"><br></div><div align=\"justify\"><i>\"<a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/10/privacy-ubuntu-1210-amazon-ads-and-data-leaks\">Privacy in Ubuntu 12.10: Amazon Ads and Data Leaks</a>”</i> (<i>„Intimitatea în Ubuntu 12.10: reclame Amazon și scurgeri de date”</i>) de Micah Lee, pe site-ul <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/\">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a></div><div align=\"justify\"><br></div><div>Copyright © 2012 Richard Stallman</div><div align=\"justify\">Publicat sub licența <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/3.0/\">Creative Commons Attribution Noderivatives 3.0</a></div><div align=\"justify\"><br></div><div align=\"justify\"><br></div><div style=\"text-indent:0cm\">[1] În limba engleză, „to kindle” înseamnă „a aprinde”, „a întreține un foc” sau „a-l alimenta” (<i>n. tr.</i>)</div><div style=\"text-indent:0cm\"><br>[2] FLISOL este un acronim de la <i>Festival Latinoamericano de Instalación de Software Libre</i> (<i>Festivalul Latinoamerican pentru Instalarea Software-ului Liber</i><span style=\"font-style:normal\">) (</span><i>n. tr.</i><span style=\"font-style:normal\">)</span></div><div><br></div></div></div>"

      "content" : "<p><br><p>I’m glad to announce that Qt 5.0 Beta 2 is now released, just in time for Qt Developer Days in Berlin. The beta puts us closer to the final release of Qt 5.0, which we anticipate to release by the end of the year.</p>\n<h3>A Full Release – Qt 5.0 Throughout</h3>\n<p>A lot of work has happened since the Beta 1 towards bringing Qt 5 closer to a final release. One of the biggest differences is that this Qt 5.0 release includes not only the Qt libraries, but also the tools. Qt Creator 2.6 based on Qt 5.0 is now bundled together with Qt 5.0 to make it a full complete release. It also helps us in testing and verifying the quality of Qt 5.</p>\n<p>This release will only support Qt 5.0, but we will later examine whether and how we can add Qt 4.x support to it.</p>\n<p>In addition, it shows that Qt 5 is a good and mature release with a very high degree of compatibility with Qt 4.x. Qt Creator can currently be built both against Qt 4.8 and 5.0 from a single code base. This proves that Qt 5.0 is almost fully source-compatible with Qt 4.8.</p>\n<h3>Qt 5.0 Functionality</h3>\n<p>With Qt 5.0 Beta 2, we have now finalized the list of modules and packages that will be part of the 5.0 final release. Qt 5.0 will contain the following libraries:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Qt Essentials</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Qt Core</li>\n<li>Qt Network</li>\n<li>Qt Gui</li>\n<li>Qt Sql</li>\n<li>Qt Testlib</li>\n<li>Qt Widgets</li>\n<li>Qt Qml</li>\n<li>Qt Quick</li>\n<li>Qt Multimedia</li>\n<li>Qt WebKit</li>\n<li>Qt WebKit Widgets</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Qt Add-ons</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Qt Xml</li>\n<li>Qt XmlPatterns</li>\n<li>Qt Svg</li>\n<li>Qt Concurrent</li>\n<li>Qt Printsupport</li>\n<li>Qt DBus</li>\n<li>Qt OpenGL</li>\n<li>Qt ActiveQt</li>\n<li>Qt Graphical Effects</li>\n<li>Qt Script</li>\n<li>Qt Declarative</li>\n<li>Qt Image Formats</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Tools and other functionality<br>\n</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Qt Assistant</li>\n<li>Qt Linguist</li>\n<li>Qt Designer</li>\n<li>Qt Translations</li>\n<li>Qt Creator</li>\n<li>Qt Documentation</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As you can see, there is a lot of functionality included in Qt 5.0., but some modules like Qt 3D have been excluded from this release. However, they are still available from qt-project.org and you can use them together with Qt 5.0.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Known Issues</h3>\n<p>As this is a beta, it still has some known issues. First of all, there is still a major overhaul of the documentation planned for Qt 5.0 that didn’t make it into this beta, so you can still expect some larger changes in this area. Apart from that, there’s a lot of smaller known issues. An up-to-date list can be found at <a href=\"http://qt-project.org/wiki/Qt500beta2KnownIssues\">http://qt-project.org/wiki/Qt500beta2KnownIssues</a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Try it Out</h3>\n<p>Because this release bundles the libraries and the tools, it should now make it very easy for everybody to get started with Qt 5.0 and try it out on their own project. Please go ahead, try it out on your project and give us your feedback so that we can fix as many issues as possible for the final 5.0 release.</p>\n<p>I encourage you to download Qt 5.0 Beta 2 from the <a href=\"http://qt-project.org/downloads\" title=\"http://qt-project.org/downloads\">http://qt-project.org/downloads</a> site or from <a href=\"http://qt.digia.com/Try-Qt-Now/\">http://qt.digia.com/Try-Qt-Now/</a></p>\n<p>If you are a Qt commercial customer, you can download the release via your Digia <a href=\"http://qt.digia.com/Log-in-Customer-Portal/\" title=\"Digia Qt Customer Portal\">Qt customer portal</a>.</p>\n<p> </p></p>"

      "content" : "<p><br><p>We are happy to announce Qt Creator 2.6.0 final today. If you haven’t followed the pre-release blogs, I’ll summarize the highlights of the new version here.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">The probably most apparent change, that affects basically every Qt Creator user, is that we introduce <em>Kits</em> as a replacement for what were <em>Targets</em> in 2.5 and earlier. There you were adding Targets to a project’s configuration, from a predefined set like <em>Desktop</em> or <em>Remote Linux</em>, which were then doing some predefined “magic” things on top of the build, run and deploy configurations that they contained. We went and generalized that into Kits: A Kit contains settings for which device type to develop for (like <em>Desktop</em> or <em>Remote Linux)</em>, the sysroot, compiler, debugger and Qt version to use, and potentially a few more. You can define these yourselves, and add them to a project’s configuration, where they again contain sets of build, run and deploy configurations. That makes it easier for users to control their build and run environments, and to share configurations between projects.<a href=\"http://blog.qt.digia.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/kits_projects_mode.png?9d7bd4\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"108\" src=\"http://blog.qt.digia.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/kits_projects_mode.png?9d7bd4\" style=\"border:1px solid black\" width=\"640\"></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">To define Kits, open <em>Build &amp; Run</em> in the preferences, define your compiler in the <em>Compilers</em> tab (or make sure they were autodetected), add your Qt versions in the <em>Qt Versions</em> tab, and finally switch to the <em>Kits</em> tab and add a kit that uses the previous settings. Then go to <em>Projects</em> mode and choose <em>Add Kit</em> to add that configuration to your project.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">On the platforms front we have new experimental support for Android merged into Qt Creator from the Necessitas project. Please check on their pages for more information, a list of entry points has been collected on the <a href=\"http://qt-project.org/wiki/Necessitas\">Qt Project Wiki</a>. Also new is support for QNX/BlackBerry projects. These are really great news, and lots of thanks go to all that made that happen. On the downside we had to drop support for Symbian from Qt Creator, because of missing maintainer.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Otherwise there are lots of new bigger and smaller features and improvements all over the place. I already mentioned a few in the <a href=\"http://blog.qt.digia.com/blog/2012/09/11/qt-creator-2-6-0-beta-released/\">beta release blog</a>, other examples are full screen support on Mac OS Lion and later, that you now can write e.g. <em>foo.txt:123</em> in Locator to directly jump to a line in that file, lots of fixes and additions to the qrc file editor, like directly opening and renaming files, direct rebuilding and cleaning of .pro file based subprojects, more C++11 fixes, highlighting of macro usages, and more.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\"><a href=\"http://releases.qt-project.org/qtcreator/2.6.0/\">Download from Qt Project</a> (<a href=\"http://qt.gitorious.org/qt-creator/qt-creator/blobs/2.6/dist/changes-2.6.0\">Change log</a>)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Commercial licensees find Qt Creator packages on the <a href=\"http://qt.digia.com/Log-in-Customer-Portal\">Customer Portal</a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">If you are wondering how Qt Creator 2.6 runs on Qt 5, our upcoming Qt 5 Beta 2 release will include Qt Creator 2.6 based on Qt 5.</p></p>"

Check it out, too!</p>\n<p>Let's start.</p>\n<h2>Part IV: Working with history</h2>\n<p><strong>1. Erase all shell history</strong></p>\n<pre>\n$ rm ~/.bash_history\n</pre>\n<p>Bash keeps the shell history in a hidden file called <code>.bash_history</code>. This file is located in your home directory. To get rid of the history, just delete it.</p>\n<p>Note that if you logout after erasing the shell history, this last <code>rm ~/.bash_history</code> command will be logged. If you want to hide that you erased shell history, see the next one-liner.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Stop logging history for this session</strong></p>\n<pre>\n$ unset HISTFILE\n</pre>\n<p>The <code>HISTFILE</code> special bash variable points to the file where the shell history should be saved. If you unset it, bash won't save the history.</p>\n<p>Alternatively you can point it to <code>/dev/null</code>,</p>\n<pre>\n$ HISTFILE=/dev/null\n</pre>\n<p><strong>3. Don't log the current command to history</strong></p>\n<p>Just start the command with an extra space:</p>\n<pre>\n$  command\n</pre>\n<p>If the command starts with an extra space, it's not logged to history.</p>\n<p>Note that this only works if the <code>HISTIGNORE</code> variable is properly configured. This variable contains <code>:</code> separated values of command prefixes that shouldn't be logged.</p>\n<p>For example to ignore spaces set it to this:</p>\n<pre>\nHISTIGNORE=\"[ ]*\"\n</pre>\n<p>My <code>HISTIGNORE</code> looks like this:</p>\n<pre>\nHISTIGNORE=&quot;&amp;:[ ]*&quot;\n</pre>\n<p>The ampersand has a special meaning - don't log repeated commands.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Change the file where bash logs command history</strong></p>\n<pre>\n$ HISTFILE=~/docs/shell_history.txt\n</pre>\n<p>Here we simply change the <code>HISTFILE</code> special bash variable and point it to <code>~/docs/shell_history.txt</code>. From now on bash will save the command history in that file.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Add timestamps to history log</strong></p>\n<pre>\n$ HISTTIMEFORMAT=\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\"\n</pre>\n<p>If you set the <code>HISTTIMEFORMAT</code> special bash variable to a valid date format (see <code>man 3 strftime</code>) then bash will log the timestamps to the history log. It will also display them when you call the <code>history</code> command (see the next one-liner).</p>\n<p><strong>6. Show the history</strong></p>\n<pre>\n$ history\n</pre>\n<p>The <code>history</code> command displays the history list with line numbers. If <code>HISTTIMEFORMAT</code> is set, it also displays the timestamps.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Show the last 50 commands from the history</strong></p>\n<pre>\n$ history 50\n</pre>\n<p>If you specify a numeric argument, such as 50, to <code>history</code>, it prints the last 50 commands from the history.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Show the top 10 most used commands from the bash history</strong></p>\n<pre>\n$ history |\n    sed 's/^ \\+//;s/  / /' |\n    cut -d' ' -f2- |\n    awk '{ count[$0]++ } END { for (i in count) print count[i], i }' |\n    sort -rn |\n    head -10\n</pre>\n<p>This one-liner combines bash with sed, cut, awk, sort and head. The perfect combination. Let's walk through this to understand what happens. Let's say the output of <code>history</code> is:</p>\n<pre>\n$ history\n    1  rm .bash_history \n    2  dmesg\n    3  su -\n    4  man cryptsetup\n    5  dmesg\n</pre>\n<p>First we use the <code>sed</code> command to remove the leading spaces and convert the double space after the history command number to a single space:</p>\n<pre>\n$ history | sed 's/^ \\+//;s/  / /'\n1 rm .bash_history \n2 dmesg\n3 su -\n4 man cryptsetup\n5 dmesg\n</pre>\n<p>Next we use <code>cut</code> to remove the first column (the history numbers):</p>\n<pre>\n$ history |\n    sed 's/^ \\+//;s/  / /' |\n    cut -d' ' -f2-\n\nrm .bash_history \ndmesg\nsu -\nman cryptsetup\ndmesg\n</pre>\n<p>Next we use <code>awk</code> to record how many times each command has been seen:</p>\n<pre>\n$ history |\n    sed 's/^ \\+//;s/  / /' |\n    cut -d' ' -f2- |\n    awk '{ count[$0]++ } END { for (i in count) print count[i], i }'\n\n1 rm .bash_history \n2 dmesg\n1 su -\n1 man cryptsetup\n</pre>\n<p>Then we sort the output numerically and reverse it:</p>\n<pre>\n$ history |\n    sed 's/^ \\+//;s/  / /' |\n    cut -d' ' -f2- |\n    awk '{ count[$0]++ } END { for (i in count) print count[i], i }' |\n    sort -rn\n\n2 dmesg\n1 rm .bash_history \n1 su -\n1 man cryptsetup\n</pre>\n<p>Finally we take the first 10 lines that correspond to 10 most frequently used commands:</p>\n<pre>\n$ history |\n    sed 's/^ \\+//;s/  / /' |\n    cut -d' ' -f2- |\n    awk '{ count[$0]++ } END { for (i in count) print count[i], i }' |\n    sort -rn |\n    head -10\n</pre>\n<p>Here is what my 10 most frequently used commands look like:</p>\n<pre>\n2172 ls\n1610 gs\n252 cd ..\n215 gp\n213 ls -las\n197 cd projects\n155 gpu\n151 cd\n119 gl\n119 cd tests/\n</pre>\n<p>Here I've <code>gs</code> that's an alias for <code>git status</code>, <code>gp</code> is <code>git push</code>, <code>gpu</code> is <code>git pull</code> and <code>gl</code> is <code>git log</code>.</p>\n<p><strong>8. Execute the previous command quickly</strong></p>\n<pre>\n$ !!\n</pre>\n<p>That's right. Type two bangs. The first bang starts history substitution, and the second one refers to the last command. Here is an example:</p>\n<pre>\n$ echo foo\nfoo\n$ !!\nfoo\n</pre>\n<p>Here the <code>echo foo</code> command was repeated.</p>\n<p>It's especially useful if you wanted to execute a command through <code>sudo</code> but forgot. Then all you've to do is run:</p>\n<pre>\n$ rm /var/log/something\nrm: cannot remove `/var/log/something': Permission denied\n$\n$ sudo !!   # executes `sudo rm /var/log/something`\n</pre>\n<p><strong>9. Execute the most recent command starting with the given string</strong></p>\n<pre>\n$ !foo\n</pre>\n<p>The first bang starts history substitution, and the second one refers to the most recent command starting with <code>foo</code>.</p>\n<p>For example,</p>\n<pre>\n$ echo foo\nfoo\n$ ls /\n/bin /boot /home /dev /proc /root /tmp\n$ awk -F: '{print $2}' /etc/passwd\n...\n$ !ls\n/bin /boot /home /dev /proc /root /tmp\n</pre>\n<p>Here we executed commands <code>echo</code>, <code>ls</code>, <code>awk</code>, and then used <code>!ls</code> to refer to the <code>ls /</code> command.</p>\n<p><strong>10. Open the previous command you executed in a text editor</strong></p>\n<pre>\n$ fc\n</pre>\n<p>Fc opens the previous command in a text editor. It's useful if you've a longer, more complex command and want to edit it.</p>\n<p>For example, let's say you've written a one-liner that has an error, such as:</p>\n<pre>\n$ for wav in wav/*; do mp3=$(sed &#39;s/\\.wav/\\.mp3/&#39; &lt;&lt;&lt; &quot;$wav&quot;); ffmpeg -i &quot;$wav&quot; &quot;$m3p&quot;; done\n</pre>\n<p>And you can't see what's going on because you've to scroll around, then you can simply type <code>fc</code> to load it in your text editor, and then quickly find that you mistyped <code>mp3</code> at the end.</p>\n<h2>Enjoy!</h2>\n<p>Enjoy the article and let me know in the comments what you think about it. In the next sub-part I'll continue discussing history keyboard shortcuts, history shell options and more.</p>\n<div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/catonmat?a=BTsR6NA3rgM:yw7y-XnGPKE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/catonmat?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/catonmat?a=BTsR6NA3rgM:yw7y-XnGPKE:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/catonmat?i=BTsR6NA3rgM:yw7y-XnGPKE:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/catonmat?a=BTsR6NA3rgM:yw7y-XnGPKE:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/catonmat?i=BTsR6NA3rgM:yw7y-XnGPKE:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/catonmat?a=BTsR6NA3rgM:yw7y-XnGPKE:XiUCZPyL81w\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/catonmat?d=XiUCZPyL81w\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/catonmat?a=BTsR6NA3rgM:yw7y-XnGPKE:DhrJZwOgkxs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/catonmat?d=DhrJZwOgkxs\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/catonmat/~4/BTsR6NA3rgM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

      "content" : "<img src=\"http://planet.debian.org/heads/highvoltage.png\" width=\"76\" height=\"110\" alt=\"\" align=\"right\" style=\"float:right\">  <br><h3>My foray into the world of LXC and RLXC</h3>\n<p>A few months ago, I started trying out <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LXC\">LXC</a> (Linux Containers). Before that I used to use <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenVZ\">OpenVZ</a>, which is an older and more mature contextualization implementation. I was pleased with how well LXC worked and started replacing my personal OpenVZ hosts with LXC.</p>\n<p>It worked great, but it had a few quirks. While LXC itself works well, the user scripts that ship with it has some space for improvement. The lxc-list command lists anything that’s a directory in /var/lib/lxc, so if you have a lost+found directory, it will list it as a container (This has since been fixed upstream). Also, in some cases it would list containers twice or not at all. I was a bit annoyed with that, since OpenVZ’s “vzlist” tool prints out a nice table of your containers along with their IP addresses and other information. Since it’s very trivial to implement what I want in a shell script, I went ahead and did just that and called it RLXC.</p>\n<p>I also missed the “vzctl exec &lt;containername&gt; command” to execute commands in containers and “vzctl enter &lt;containername&gt;” to gain a shell inside the container, so I added some more functionality to it so that I could configure ssh keys for these containers and use “rlxc enter” and “rlxc exec” like I used to do with the OpenVZ tools, but by using SSH.</p>\n<p>I also realised that there are <a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_name=4FEDCBE7.2070709%40ubuntu.com&amp;forum_name=lxc-devel\">others too</a> who wanted similar improvements in the LXC scripts and decided to continue improving RLXC and making it public.</p>\n<h3>Enter LLXC</h3>\n<p>I spoke to <a href=\"http://www.stgraber.org/\">Stéphane</a> about my ideas at the time and he introduced me to <a href=\"http://www.stgraber.org/2012/09/28/introducing-the-python-lxc-api/\">python3-lxc that he introduced on his blog</a> yesterday. It provides Python bindings for liblxc, so I took the advantage of that and mostly re-implemented RLXC in Python and called it LLXC. The name doesn’t particularly mean anything, I’m open to suggestions for what to call it, if anyone cares.</p>\n<p>Here are some screenshots that explains some of it better than I could do in words:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://jonathancarter.org/files/images/llxclist1.png\" title=\"The llxc list command, which sparked this off\" height=\"296\" width=\"555\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://jonathancarter.org/files/images/llxclistarchive.png\" title=\"list or archived containers\" height=\"171\" width=\"555\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://jonathancarter.org/files/images/llxcstatus1.png\" title=\"llxc status command\" height=\"509\" width=\"555\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://jonathancarter.org/files/images/llxccreate.png\" title=\"creating a new container\" height=\"127\" width=\"555\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://jonathancarter.org/files/images/llxcenter1.png\" title=\"entering a container via ssh\" height=\"112\" width=\"555\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://jonathancarter.org/files/images/llxcexec.png\" title=\"execute a command via ssh, this example shows an exit code warning as a result of a typo\" height=\"86\" width=\"555\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://jonathancarter.org/files/images/llxcdestroy.png\" title=\"destroying a running container\" height=\"99\" width=\"555\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h3>How to get it</h3>\n<p>As Stéphane mentioned in the python3-lxc blog entry, the API hasn’t yet been finalized and llxc itself is in an early state and many changes are planned, so it’s definitely not meant for production use yet, but since we believe in “release early, release often” in the free software community, here goes…</p>\n<p>Currently, llxc.py itself is *very* Ubuntu specific and its only been tested on Ubuntu 12.04, but that will be fixed once more of its kinks have been ironed out. Some people are also working on getting python3-lxc on other distributions, which will help a lot.</p>\n<p>The llxc.py script itself is hosted on Github: <a href=\"https://github.com/highvoltage/llxc\">https://github.com/highvoltage/llxc</a></p>\n<p>For python3-lxc and friends, you need to enable Stéphane’s experimental PPA: <a href=\"https://launchpad.net/~stgraber/+archive/experimental\">https://launchpad.net/~stgraber/+archive/experimental</a></p>\n<p>You will then need to install the following packages: lxc, python3-lxc, python3-crypto, lvm, btrfs-tools</p>\n<p>To generate the ssh keys used for ssh interaction between the containers, you need to run “llxc gensshkeys”.  The “enter” and “exec” commands also rely on your containers being in dns or in your /etc/hosts file, at least for now, which you may have to configure manually.</p>\n<h3>The Future</h3>\n<p>There is a lot that I’m planning to add, mostly to scratch my own itches. These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Awareness of other hosts, so that the list command can show you all containers in the “awareness”. You’d also be able to clone, move, etc containers between hosts.</li>\n<li>Easily modify container configuration</li>\n<li>Hooks everywhere, and at least one hook for configuring a configuration management system such as salt, bcfg2, puppet or chef.</li>\n<li>More checks and tips everywhere. Is the host running low on memory? Disk space? Perhaps list available resources on variable hosts and make some suggestions based on that.</li>\n<li>There a not-very-descriptive ROADMAP file in the distribution, check that for more details.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I’ll have some packaging for this available soon and work on making more things work right out of the box, updates will follow. Also, feedback and patches are very welcome!</p>"

Following <a href=\"https://lists.debian.org/debian-publicity/2012/08/msg00005.html\">Francesca's invitation</a> (and <a href=\"http://raphaelhertzog.com/2012/08/16/happy-birthday-debian-and-memories-of-an-old-timer/\">Raphaël's lead</a>, and using <a href=\"http://leogg.wordpress.com/2012/08/16/happy-birthday-debian/\">Leandro's image</a>, collaboratively as it always happens here), I will tell a bit of my memories: How I got to Debian.</p>\n<p>I am a Debian user since ~2000, and a Debian Developer since April 2003. But, just as Raphaël's, my history must go somewhat further back in time.</p>\n<p>In 1992, I got my first 1200bps modem, and almost immediately became an avid <a href=\"https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_Board_System\">BBS</a> user (what's that? <a href=\"http://www.matuk.com/teclado/1994/may-02-1994.html\">Javier Matuk talks [in Spanish] about BBSes in his newspaper column back in 1994</a>). By mid 1993 I started operating my own BBS, CatarSYS. One of the key points that defined CatarSYS is that my focus was large-scale communication. I started connecting to several BBS networks, allowing messages to be relayed to distant people, mainly in the USA and Spain, and getting some feeds that could be seen as the <em>poor man's Usenet</em>.</p>\n<p>At some point during the year I kept CatarSYS going, I got connected through a strange set of gateways to pure gold: A UUCP feed! This means, during some months, I operated the first (free, hobbyist) service that offered its users a free Internet mail address in Mexico. Yes, it was completely different to what we are used to today. I tried to connect to my provider at least three times a week, but this meant less than one week turnover time for messages sent to people anywhere in the world! But, back to Debian: Via this UUCP feed, I also got some <em>real</em> Usenet newsgroups — Including several on the <tt>comp.os</tt> category. I remember reading about Linux back then, and learning some commands, but didn't really get hooked into it.</p>\n<p>I was in Israel from July 1994 to June 1995, doing completely non-computer-related tasks. Came back in 1995, and due to my father being an academic, got dialup internet access at home. WOW, *real* Internet!</p>\n<p>It didn't take me long to start downloading Linux information and floppy images. One failed after another. But before the end of the year, I found in a bookshop a book (that included a CD-ROM) called \"Build your own web server with Linux\". WOW again — Remember this was still 1995! I bought it, and shortly afterwards, I had a Slackware system (Linux kernel 1.0.9) running. That meant many sleepless nights full of joy and frustration (as getting hardware to work was cloe to impossible).</p>\n<p>By 1996, I got (within one week) my two first real jobs: A systems administrator at a small ISP and a highschool teacher. At the ISP, I got a spare computer to play with Linux, as –of course– the Big Server was running with Windows NT 3.51. Poor little machine... By then I was already a part of the Mexican Linux User Group. This group had just printed a batch of Linux CDs — RedHat 4.0. This was the first release that <em>really</em> made me happy and allowed me to do good work. Together with a friend I took to work with us, Juan Pablo Romero, we installed over a weekend a full replacement for our buggy NT machine, in much cheaper hardware. Of course, Linux was nowhere near corporate-recognition, and our project remained a project, not touching the Windows machine.</p>\n<p>Anyway... Several years passed, and I was happy with my RedHat choice. I won't mention the milestones and job changes, as it would get boring and leave the point completely aside. By the year 2000, I was quite more involved with the LUG, as well as with the computer security group in DGSCA-UNAM. I became also an OpenBSD user, and had got so hooked up in free software that I felt the need to collaborate: To be a little part of one of those Big Projects that had given me so much. But which one?</p>\n<p>I have never been much of a programmer — Yes, I can solve my everyday needs and have fun with it, and sometimes a bit beyond that. I enjoy programming. But all of my projects have begun little… and stayed little. I wanted to join OpenBSD, as it was a community I really believed in, but given my skillset (and given a flame-prone, aggressive developer community), I lost motivation to do so.</p>\n<p>By 2000, I had also lost faith in RedHat. I don't have the exact dates, so I might be some months off — But after RedHat's IPO, I felt a sharp change. Version 7.0 was really demotivating — It tried to offer a polished desktop experience, but was really buggy, unstable, and full of bad decisions. In Mexico, Pepe Neif had taken up the job of making a derivative distribution of RedHat (called LinuxPPP), pressing hundreds of CDs and making a teaching program I was part of several times. Talking with Pepe (who continued to release based on RedHat 6), he told me he was interested in switching over to become a Debian-based distribution, but the job of migrating his installed base made the project stall — LinuxPPP reached only version 6.4.</p>\n<p>But I installed Debian in early 2000, and loved it. I started getting familiar with its social philosophy and foundation documents at the same time I started migrating my servers from RedHat to Debian — This must have been by Spring 2000, as I installed Potato while it was frozen but not yet stable.</p>\n<p>By January 2002 I applied for NM. My process took a long time, as my AM got MIA when he had already approved me (but before sending the AM report), so basically I had to go through AM twice — And by April 16, 2003, I got accepted as a DD. Contrary to what is acceptable today, I requested the full process to be done before starting to maintain any packages, as I didn't want to bother people with package sponsorship requests, so my whole process was done evaluating packages I would <em>eventually</em> upload.</p>\n<p>Since becoming a DD, my main involvement in the project has been in packaging groups (I was a pkg-perl founder and member for many years, and am currently working in the pkg-ruby-extras group). But, as I said, my main strength is not programming — So my main involvement in Debian has been more social than technical: I have been a DebConf organizer since 2005, a very interesting, stressing, rewarding and (for some months) time-demanding role, and since 2009 I am part of the keyring maintainence team, which is much easier workload, although carries important ramifications.</p>\n<p>So, after 19 years of Debian, and after nine years of me being part of it, Debian is clearly my strongest link to the Free Software community, a project I have grown to love and whose way of being I share and enjoy studying and explaining. And it is a technically excellent product, and a great place to start and keep learning both about how every aspect and layer of an operating system works, and how human-to-human interaction works in such a diverse, almost impossible environment happens. </p>\n<p>Congratulations, Debian!</p>\n\n\n\n\n<table>\n <thead><tr><th>Attachment</th><th>Size</th> </tr></thead>\n<tbody>\n <tr><td><a href=\"http://gwolf.org/files/debian-19_500.png\">debian-19_500.png</a></td><td>149.81 KB</td> </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"

If the loop is too complex\nor if it depends on the previous iteration, the compiler will fail to vectorize.\n(Even if it would be obvious for an human). The vectorization therefore has to be done manually.</p>\n<p>\nThis is where <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrinsic_function\">compiler intrinsics</a>\nhelp us. They are special functions handled directly in the compiler who will emit the instruction we want.\n</p>\n<p>The problem with intrinsics is that they are not really portable. They target a specific architecture.\nThis means you need to write your algorithms for the different CPU architectures you target.\nFortunately, the main compilers use the same intrinsics\n so they are portable across compilers and operating systems.\n</p>\n<p>You are supposed to detect the support of the instruction set at run-time.\nWhat is usually done is to write several variants of the function for the different target architecture\n and have a function pointer that is set to the best variant for the running architecture.\n</p>\n\n <p>The best documentation I could find is\n <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/26td21ds\">the reference on MSDN</a>.\n You will have to browse it a bit to see what the available intrinsics are. </p>\n\n\n<h2>The Task: Converting UTF-8 to UTF-16</h2>\n\n<p>I got interested in SIMD when <a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/in/benjaminpoulain\">Benjamin</a> was using them to speed up\n <a href=\"http://qt.gitorious.org/qt/qt/blobs/v4.8.2/src/corelib/tools/qstring.cpp#line3839\">QString::fromLatin1</a>,\n which  converts a <code>char*</code> encoded in\n <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin1\">Latin-1</a> to\n <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-16\">UTF-16</a> (QString's internal encoding).\n After he explained to me how it works, I was able to speed up some of the drawing code inside Qt.\n <br>\n However in Qt5, we\n <a href=\"http://www.macieira.org/blog/2012/05/source-code-must-be-utf-8-and-qstring-wants-it/\">\n changed the default string encoding</a> from Latin-1 to UTF-8.\n</p><p>\n <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8\">UTF-8</a> can represent all of Unicode\n while  Latin-1 can only represent the alphabet of a few latin based languages.\n     UTF-8 parsing is much more difficult to vectorize because\n     a single code point can be encoded by a variable number of bytes.</p>\n\n\n <p>\nThis table explains the correspondence between the bits in UTF-8 and UTF-16:\n</p>\n\n<table border=\"1\">\n<tr><th></th><th>UTF-8</th><th>UTF-16</th></tr>\n<tr><td>ASCII (1 byte)</td>\n                  <td><code>0<span>aaaaaaa</span></code></td>\n                  <td><code>00000000 0<span>aaaaaaa</span></code></td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Basic Multilingual Plane<br>(2 or 3 bytes)</td>\n                <td><code>110<span>bbb</span><span>bb</span>\n                              10<span>aaaaaa</span></code></td>\n                  <td><code>00000<span>bbb</span>\n                            <span>bb</span><span>aaaaaa</span></code></td>\n\n</tr>\n<tr>\n                <td><code>1110<span>cccc</span>\n                              10<span>bbbb</span><span>bb</span>\n                              10<span>aaaaaa</span></code></td>\n                  <td><code><span>cccc</span><span>bbbb</span>\n                            <span>bb</span><span>aaaaaa</span></code></td>   \n</tr>\n<tr><td>Supplementary Planes <br> (4 bytes)</td>\n                 <td><code>11110<span>ddd</span>\n                              10<span>dd</span><span>cccc</span>\n                              10<span>bb</span><span>bb</span><span>bb</span>\n                              10<span>aaaaaa</span></code> <br>\n                              <code><span>uuuu</span> = <span>ddddd</span> - 1</code> </td>\n                  <td><code>110110<span>uu uu</span><span>cccc</span><span>bb</span> <br>\n                            110111<span>bb</span>\n                            <span>bb</span><span>aaaaaa</span></code></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n <p>I was wondering if we could improve QString::fromUtf8 using SIMD. <br>\n \nMost of the strings are just ASCII which is easy to vectorize,\nbut I wanted to also try to go ahead and vectorize the more complicated cases as well.<br>\nHowever, the 4 bytes sequences (Supplementary Planes) are very rarely used\n(most used languages and useful symbols are already in the Basic Multilingual Plane)\nand also more complicated so I did not vectorize that case for\nthe scope of this blog post.\nThis is left as an exercise for the reader ;-)</p>\n\n<h2>Previous work</h2>\n\n<p>UTF-8 processing is a very common task. I was expecting that the problem would be already solved.\nCurrently however most libraries and applications still have a scalar implementation.\nFew  use vectorization, but only for ASCII.</p>\n<p>There is a library called <a href=\"http://u8u16.costar.sfu.ca/\">u8u16</a>.\nIt uses a clever technique by separating the bits in individual vectors.\nIt is processing 128 char at the time in 8 different vectors.<br>\nI wanted to try a different approach and work directly on one vector.\n   Working with 16 char at the time allows speeding up the processing of\n    smaller strings.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Easy Case: ASCII</h2>\n\n<p>I'm going to start by explaining the simple case when we only\nhave ASCII. This is very easy to vectorize because for ASCII one byte in UTF-8\nis always one byte in UTF-16 with <code>\\0</code> bytes in between.<br>\nASCII is also a very common encoding so it make sense to have a special case for it.</p>\n\n<p>I will start by showing the code and then explaining it</p>\n\n<p>Our function takes a pointer <code>src</code> to the UTF-8 buffer of length <code>len</code>,\n   and a pointer <code>dst</code> to a buffer of size at least <code>len*2</code>\n   where we will store the UTF-16 output.

This information will be stored in vectors that we can use to mask\n    so operations we do later operate only on a certain category of bytes.    \n</li>\n<li>Then, we will <b>operate on the data</b> to to find the actual Unicode value behind\n    each character.  They will be stored at the location of the last byte of a sequence,\n    into two different vectors: one for the low bits and one for the high bits.\n    </li>\n<li>Then we need to <b>shuffle</b> the vectors to remove the\n  possible \"gaps\" left by multi-bytes sequences.\n  </li>\n<li> Finally, we can store the result and <b>advance</b> the pointers.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I will explain every step in more detail.</p>\n\n<p>In our example, I will decode the string\n<em>x<span>≤</span>(<span>α</span>+<span>β</span>)<span>²</span><span>γ</span><span>²</span></em>,\nwhich is represented in UTF-8 as\n<code>x<span>\\e2\\89\\a4</span>(<span>\\ce\\b1</span>+<span>\\ce\\b2</span>)<span>\\c2\\b2</span><span>\\ce\\b3</span><span>\\c2\\b2</span></code>.\nThe \"≤\" is represented by 3 bytes, the Greek letters by two bytes,\nand the \"²\" also by two bytes. The total length is 17 bytes, so the last byte\nwill be truncated when loaded into the vector</p>\n<h2>Classification</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At the end of this step, we will have the following vectors:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b><code>mask</code></b> tells which bit needs to be set to 0 in order to only keep the bits\n   that are going to end up in the Unicode value.\n   Bits of mask that are set will be unset from the data.</li>\n<li><b><code>count</code></b> is zero if the corresponding byte is ASCII or a continuation byte.\n If the corresponding byte is starting a sequence, then it is the number of bytes in that sequence.\n </li>\n\n <li><b><code>counts</code></b> represents (for each byte) how many bytes are remaining in this sequence.\n It is 0 for ASCII, 1 for the last byte in a sequence, and so on.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>We start by finding <code>count</code> and <code>mask</code>.\n I do that by computing a vector\n  that I called <code>state</code>, in which the 5 higher bits are the mask and the\n   3 lower bits represent the count.\n</p>\n\n<img src=\"http://woboq.com/blog/utf-8-processing-using-simd/classification.png\">\n\n<p>We will use the\n<code><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/9s46csht\">_mm_cmplt_epi8</a></code> instruction.\nIt compares two vectors of 16 signed char,\nand returns a mask vector where each byte is equal to <code>0xff</code>\n or <code>0x00</code> depending of the result of the comparison between\n the corresponding chars.\n <br>We can then use this mask as input to the\n <code><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb514064\">_mm_blendv_epi8</a></code>\n  SSE4 instruction.\n It takes 3 input arguments: two vectors and a mask.

We just need to advance the source and destination pointers.\nThe source pointer usually advance by 16, unless it ends in the middle of a sequence.\nIn that case, we need to roll back 1 or 2 chars.

The rest was mainly having\n2 bytes sequences and very few 3 bytes sequences.  There is no sequence of 4 bytes.<br>\nAlso consider that the processing of UTF-8 is probably far from being the bottleneck\nof any application that does something useful.</p>\n<p>So was my exercise useless? Maybe in practice, but I think there is still\nsomething to learn from this that can be applied to another algorithm that might\nbe a bottleneck.</p><div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.woboq.com/~ff/woboq?a=1HHx71wwR1U:eVp_8oqk20o:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/woboq?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.woboq.com/~ff/woboq?a=1HHx71wwR1U:eVp_8oqk20o:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/woboq?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.woboq.com/~ff/woboq?a=1HHx71wwR1U:eVp_8oqk20o:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/woboq?i=1HHx71wwR1U:eVp_8oqk20o:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.woboq.com/~ff/woboq?a=1HHx71wwR1U:eVp_8oqk20o:8NgEvh26xlc\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/woboq?d=8NgEvh26xlc\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div>"

      "content" : "<p></p><p>The QML core team down under gained a new friend for Qt 5. We finally have the privilege of working with a designer in our team and he’s been helping us in our quest to make QML the most designer friendly UI language. We have created a small video to show you the latest apps and games from our team. But remember that videos aren’t the main point of Qt demos, the source code for these demos is all available from qt-project.org and it’s BSD licensed. I’ll even sprinkle links throughout this post to show the code behind all the new features that have me excited.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>First have a look at our new calculator demo, Calqlatr, which has been restyled like the other demos. From its humble few hundred LoC beginnings, SameGame is also looking like a real application now. The new particle effects look even better, and you have your choice of four game modes. This includes a mode that loads preset levels, also <a href=\"http://qt.gitorious.org/qt/qtdeclarative/blobs/master/examples/demos/samegame/content/levels/level0.qml\" title=\"SameGame QML defined level\">written in QML</a>.</p>\n<p>QML demos are really easy to modify and play with; SameGame <a href=\"http://qt.gitorious.org/qt/qtdeclarative/blobs/master/examples/demos/samegame/samegame.qml#line130\" title=\"samegame main menu source\">selects a new theme</a> per game mode already, so you can try out your own samegame designs with ease. We also have a new game, “Maroon in Trouble”, with an underwater theme inspired by the rich life at the Great Barrier Reef. The game is highly customizable with the towers implemented <a href=\"http://qt.gitorious.org/qt/qtdeclarative/blobs/master/examples/demos/maroon/content/towers/Melee.qml\" title=\"The Melee tower in Maroon\">in QML</a>, both for their appearance and their gameplay attributes.</p>\n<p>When you watched the video of “Maroon in Trouble”, you’ll notice that it avails itself of some of the new visual embellishments available in QtQuick 2. The particle system allows for <a href=\"http://qt.gitorious.org/qt/qtdeclarative/blobs/master/examples/demos/maroon/maroon.qml#line61\" title=\"Bubble system source\">bubbles</a> and <a href=\"http://qt.gitorious.org/qt/qtdeclarative/blobs/master/examples/demos/maroon/content/GameOverScreen.qml#line61\" title=\"Cloud system source\">clouds</a> to float all over the screen, while the new sprite elements made the game piece animations trivial to implement. As a bonus, the game has sound effects if you have the QtMultimedia module installed – a benefit of the modularization work in Qt 5.</p>\n<p>The new visual effects aren’t just for games though. The completely redesigned twitter search app, TweetSearch, uses sprites and shaders for much more subtle designs. The central logo has a touch of animation to keep the main screen from being static, and the rotating bars use <a href=\"http://qt.gitorious.org/qt/qtdeclarative/blobs/master/examples/demos/tweetsearch/content/FlipBar.qml\" title=\"FlipBar source\">a custom ShaderEffect</a> to get that three dimensional look (although you could use the Qt3D module instead). It also uses view transitions to populate in a more fluid fashion.</p>\n<p>If you still can’t get the beautiful effects you want with all these new visual elements, QtQuick 2 also introduces the Canvas element for imperative painting. Especially good for graphing data, see it in action with the new StocQt <a href=\"http://qt.gitorious.org/qt/qtdeclarative/trees/master/examples/demos/stockchart\" title=\"StocQt still under development\">stock chart viewer</a> example.</p>\n<p>The QML core team is really proud of how well QtQuick 2 has developed. This is especially true since modules from the other Brisbane teams, like the team behind QtMultimedia, are finally inside Qt after the modularization efforts. I hope that our demos help launch other developers to write even better games and apps.</p>"

Sigh.  Incidentally, if smartmontools isn’t installed on your machine, whether it’s a laptop, desktop, or server, it should be.</p>\n<p>Although most of you know I run Linux on the metal on my machines almost exclusively, I do maintain a small drive with a Windows installation that I boot into every few months for various reasons.  This is that drive.</p>\n<p>The drive is non-redundant (no RAID), and although it is backed up, the backup is made via backuppc from the NTFS filesystem mounted on Linux, and is a partial backup – backing up certain data, not the OS.  There are, of course, bare metal Windows backup solutions, but I generally don’t want to back up Windows from within Windows on this machine.  Restoring Windows isn’t quite as simple as an mkfs, an untar, and a grub-install, either.</p>\n<p>So my first thought is: immediately save whatever of the drive I can.  So I ran <tt>apt-get install gddrescue</tt> to install the GNU ddrescue tool.  ddrescue is somewhat similar to dd, but deals much more intelligently with bad blocks on the drive.  It will try to read them repeatedly, with decreasing block sizes, in an effort to get every last good byte off the disk that it can.  If it ultimately fails to get certain bytes read, it will write placeholder data to the output file in place of the missing data, so that the output file maintains proper size and alignment.  It also saves a log file that notes what it found (see <tt>info ddrescue</tt> for more on that.)</p>\n<p>So I created an LVM volume for the purpose (not enough free space on /home, and didn’t want to have to shrink it somehow later), and ran:</p>\n<pre>ddrescue /dev/sda /mnt/sdasave.ddrescue /mnt/sdasave.logfile</pre>\n<p>Then I went to dinner.</p>\n<p>When I got back, I discovered there were 1 or 2 bad sectors, about halfway through the disk, but everything else was fine.  So now, the question became: did I lose any data?  If so, what?  I needed to know if I had to revert to a backup for anything or not.</p>\n<p>To answer THAT question, first I had to figure out the offset of the bad spots on the disk.  That’s not too hard; the logfile gives it to me:</p>\n<pre># Rescue Logfile. Created by GNU ddrescue version 1.15\n# Command line: ddrescue /dev/sda /mnt/sdasave.ddrescue sdasave.logfile\n# current_pos  current_status\n0x3BBB8BFC00     +\n#      pos        size  status\n0x00000000  0x3BBB8BF000  +\n0x3BBB8BF000  0x00001000  -\n0x3BBB8C0000  0x38B5346000  +\n</pre>\n<p>what we see is that the bad sector starts at byte 0x3BBB8BF000 (256549580800 decimal) and extends for 0×1000 bytes (4096 decimal).  Both the drive and NTFS use 512-byte sectors.  So dividing by 512, we get sector 501073400 – 501073407 (4096 bytes is 8 sectors).</p>\n<p>As a check, I ran <tt>grep sector /var/log/kern.log</tt> and turned up a bunch of lines like this:</p>\n<p>Jun 14 21:39:11 hephaestus kernel: [35346.929957] end_request: I/O error, dev sda, sector 501073404</p>\n<p>Which is within my calculated range.</p>\n<p>But this is an absolute sector on the disk.  We need the sector within the partition, so for that, we have to enlist fdisk to make that calculation.</p>\n<p>fdisk shows, among other things:</p>\n<pre>Units = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\n   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sda1   *        2048   976771071   488384512    7  HPFS/NTFS/exFAT\n</pre>\n<p>So the Windows partition starts at disk sector 2048.</p>\n<p>Let’s just confirm that.  If I use <tt>dd if=/dev/sda1 bs=512 count=1 | hd | head</tt>, I see a line beginning with “.R.NTFS”.  Exactly the same as with <tt>dd if=/dev/sda bs=512 count=1 skip=2048 | hd | head</tt>, so I read the partition table information correctly.</p>\n<p>Subtract offset of 2048 from the earlier values, and I get relative sectors 501071352-501071359.</p>\n<p>That’s enough to get some solid info from the filesystem via <tt>ntfscluster</tt>, part of Debian’s ntfs-3g package.  I pass -s to it, and ignoring some irrelevant stuff, get my answer:</p>\n<pre>ntfscluster -s 501071352-501071359 /dev/sda1\nInode 190604 /System Volume Information/{b4816feb-b609-11e1-a908-50e549b934f7}{3808876b-c176-4e48-b7ae-04046e6cc752}/$DATA\n</pre>\n<p>I even reran it with a much larger sector range, just to be absolutely sure I had wiggle room in case calculations had an off-by-one error or something somewhere.</p>\n<p>This is really great news, because the file in question is pretty much useless – I believe it’s a system restore point, which I won’t be needing anyhow.</p>\n<p>So at this point, all that remains is to reinstall this on a different drive.  For that, I could just use my ddrescue image.  I thought I would take a second image, just to be very extra careful, and use that; I used:</p>\n<pre>partclone.ntfs --rescue -c -s /dev/sda1 -o sda1.partclone\n</pre>\n<p>although ntfsclone would work just as well.  This captures only the partition; I’ll need the partition <i>table</i> as well, and perhaps also the space between the partition table and the first partition.  I could capture it separately with dd, but it’s already in the ddrescue image, so there’s no need.  (GRUB is installed on this drive, but there is no Linux filesystem on it, so it may well exceed the size of the MBR).</p>\n<p>Note that for Linux ext[234] filesystems, debugfs can provide the same (and more) info as I got from ntfscluster.</p>\n<p>I happen to have a drive of the right size sitting here, which I was about to install in a different machine.  So a wipe and a swap and a restore later, and I should be good to go.</p>\n<p>This scenario is commonplace enough that I thought I’d post how I dealt with it, in case anyone else ever has hard drive issues.</p>"

Another one\nwas to <a href=\"http://noone.org/blog/English/Computer/Debian/CoolTools/Finding%20libraries%20not%20marked%20as%20automatically%20installed%20with%20aptitude.futile\">implement aptitude filters to do interactively what deborphan does\nnon-interactively</a>. Yet another one is to use <a href=\"http://noone.org/blog/English/Computer/Debian/CoolTools/Friends%20of%20du.futile\">du and friends</a> a lot – <a href=\"http://packages.debian.org/ncdu\">ncdu</a> is definitely my favourite\ndu-like tool in the meanwhile.\n\n</p><p>\n\nUsing du and friends I often noticed how much disk space <code>/usr/share/doc</code> takes up. But since I value the\ncontents of <code>/usr/share/doc</code> a lot, I condemn\nhow Nokia solved that on the N900: They let APT <em>delete</em> all\nfiles and directories under <code>/usr/share/doc</code>\n(including the copyright files!) via some <a href=\"https://maemo.gitorious.org/maemo-af/docpurge\">package named\ndocpurge</a>. I also dislike <a href=\"http://www.ubuntu.com/\">Ubuntu</a>’s “solution” to truncate the\nshipped changelog files (you can still get the remainder of the files\non the web somewhere) as they’re an important source of information\nfor me.\n\n</p><p>\n\nSo when <a href=\"http://algebraicthunk.net/~dburrows/projects/aptitude/\">aptitude</a> showed me that some package suddenly wanted to use up\nquite some more disk space, I noticed that the new package version\nincluded the upstream changelog twice. So I started searching for\nduplicate files under <code>/usr/share/doc</code>.\n\n</p><p>\n\nThere are <a href=\"http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=656142#18\">quite some tools to find duplicate files in Debian</a>. <a href=\"http://packages.debian.org/hardlink\">hardlink</a> seemed most appropriate for this case.\n\n</p><p>\n\nFirst <a href=\"http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=614715#5\">I\njust looked for duplicate files per package</a>, which even on that\nless than four gigabytes installation on my EeePC found nine packages\nwhich shipped at least one file twice.\n\n</p><p>\n\nAs recommended I rather opted for an according Lintian check (see\nbugs. Niels Thykier kindly implemented such a check in Lintian and its\nfindings are as reported as tags “duplicate-changelog-files”\n(Severity: normal, from Lintian 2.5.2 on) and “duplicate-files”\n(Severity: minor, experimental, from Lintian 2.5.0 on).\n\n</p><p>\n\nNevertheless, some source packages generate several binary packages\nand all of them (of course) ship the same, in some cases quite large\n(<a href=\"http://www.debian.org/\">Debian</a>) changelog file. So I found myself running <code>hardlink /usr/share/doc</code> now and then to gain\nsome more free disk space. But as I run <a href=\"http://www.debian.org/releases/sid/\">Sid</a> and package upgrades\nhappen more than daily, I came to the conclusion that I should run\nthis command more or less after each aptitude run, i.e. automatically.\n\n</p><a name=\"howto\"></a><p>\n\nHaving taken <a href=\"http://packages.debian.org/localepurge\">localepurge</a>’s APT hook as example, I added the\nfollowing content as <code>/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/98-hardlink-doc</code> to my system:\n\n</p><pre>// Hardlink identical docs, changelogs, copyrights, examples, etc\n\nDPkg\n{\nPost-Invoke {\"if [ -x /usr/bin/hardlink ]; then /usr/bin/hardlink -t /usr/share/doc; else exit 0; fi\";};\n};\n</pre><p>\n\nSo now installing <a href=\"http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=634458\">a\npackage which contains duplicate files</a> looks like this:\n\n</p><pre>~ # aptitude install <a href=\"http://www.perl.com/\">perl</a>-tk\nThe following NEW packages will be installed:\n  perl-tk \n0 packages upgraded, 1 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.\nNeed to get 2,522 <acronym title=\"Kilobyte\">kB</acronym> of archives.

      "content" : "<img src=\"http://planet.debian.org/heads/xtaran.png\" width=\"102\" height=\"104\" alt=\"\" align=\"right\" style=\"float:right\">  Sometime the network you’re connected to is either untrusted (e.g.\nwireless) or castrated in some way. In both cases you want a tunnel to\nyour trusted home base.\n\n<p></p><p>\n\nFollowing I’ll show you three completely different tunneling tools\nwhich may helpful while travelling.\n\n</p><h4>sshuttle</h4><p>\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/apenwarr/sshuttle/\">sshuttle</a> is a tool somewhere in between of automatic port forward\nand VPN. It tunnels arbitrary TCP connections and <acronym title=\"Domain Name Service\">DNS</acronym> through an <acronym title=\"Secure Shell\">SSH</acronym>\ntunnel without requiring root access on the remote end of the <acronym title=\"Secure Shell\">SSH</acronym>\nconnection.\n\n</p><p>\n\nSo it’s perfect for redirecting most of your traffic through an <acronym title=\"Secure Shell\">SSH</acronym>\ntunnel to your favourite <acronym title=\"Secure Shell\">SSH</acronym> server, e.g. to ensure your local privacy\nwhen you are online via a public, unencrypted <acronym title=\"Wireless Local Area Network\">WLAN</acronym> (i.e. easy to sniff\nfor everyone).\n\n</p><p>\n\nIt runs on <a href=\"http://www.kernel.org/\">Linux</a> and MacOS X and only needs a <a href=\"http://www.python.org/\">Python</a> interpreter on\nthe remote side. Requires root access (usually via sudo) on the client\nside, though.\n\n</p><p>\n\nIt’s currently available at least <a href=\"http://packages.debian.org/sshuttle\">in Debian Unstable\nand Testing (Wheezy)</a> as well as in <a href=\"http://packages.ubuntu.com/sshuttle\">Ubuntu since 11.04 Natty</a>.\n\n</p><h4>Miredo</h4><p>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.remlab.net/miredo/\">Miredo</a> is an\nfree and open-source implementation of Microsoft’s NAT-traversing\nTeredo IPv6 tunneling protocol for at least Linux, <a href=\"http://www.freebsd.org/\">FreeBSD</a>, <a href=\"http://www.netbsd.org/\">NetBSD</a> and\nMacOS X.\n\n</p><p>\n\nMiredo includes not only a Teredo client but also a Teredo server\nimplementation. The developer of Miredo also runs a public Miredo\nserver, so you don’t even need to install a server somewhere. If you\nrun <a href=\"http://www.debian.org/\">Debian</a> or <a href=\"http://www.ubuntu.com/\">Ubuntu</a> you just need to do <code><a href=\"http://packages.debian.org/miredo\">apt-get\ninstall miredo</a></code> as root and you have IPv6 connectivity. It’s\nthat easy.\n\n</p><p>\n\nSo it’s perfect to get a dynamic IPv6 tunnel for your laptop or mobile\nphone independently where you are and without the need to register any\nIPv6 tunnel or configure the Miredo client.\n\n</p><p>\n\nI usually use Miredo on my netbooks to be able to access my boxes at\nhome (which are behind an IPv4 NAT router which is also an SixXS IPv6\ntunnel endpoint) from whereever I am.\n\n</p><h4>iodine</h4><p>\n\n<a href=\"http://code.kryo.se/iodine/\">iodine</a> is\nlikely the most undermining tool in this set. It tunnels IPv4 over\n<acronym title=\"Domain Name Service\">DNS</acronym>, allowing you to make arbitrary network connections if you are on\na network where nothing but <acronym title=\"Domain Name Service\">DNS</acronym> requests is allowed (i.e. only <acronym title=\"Domain Name Service\">DNS</acronym>\npackets reach the internet).\n\n</p><p>\n\nThis is often the case on wireless LANs with landing page. They\nredirect all web traffic to the landing page. But the network’s\nrouters try to avoid poisoning the client’s <acronym title=\"Domain Name Service\">DNS</acronym> cache with different\n<acronym title=\"Domain Name Service\">DNS</acronym> replies as they would get after the user is logged in. So <acronym title=\"Domain Name Service\">DNS</acronym>\npackets usually pass even the local network’s <acronym title=\"Domain Name Service\">DNS</acronym> servers unchanged,\njust TCP and other UDP packets are redirected until logging in.\n\n</p><p>\n\nWith an iodine tunnel, it is possible get a network connection to the\noutside on such a network anyway. On startup iodine tries to\nautomatically find the best parameters (MTU, request type, etc.) for\nthe current environmenent. However that may fail if any <acronym title=\"Domain Name Service\">DNS</acronym> server in\nbetween imposes <acronym title=\"Domain Name Service\">DNS</acronym> request rate limits.\n\n</p><p>\n\nTo be able to start such a tunnel you need to set up an iodine daemon\nsomewhere on the internet. Choose a server which is not already a <acronym title=\"Domain Name Service\">DNS</acronym>\nserver.\n\n</p><p>\n\niodine is available in many distributions, e.g. <a href=\"http://packages.debian.org/iodine\">in\nDebian</a> and <a href=\"http://packages.ubuntu.com/iodine\">in Ubuntu</a>.</p>"

With that build of Cyanogenmod you can press the power button for about 1.5 seconds to get a menu which gives an option to take a screen shot.</p>\n<p>The aim of the talk was to give an overview of what Android can do.

Cyanogenmod includes a terminal program which allows you to run “<b>su -</b>“. Running a shell as root isn’t generally that useful, what you really want is to be able to run programs such as <a href=\"https://play.android.com/details?id=com.keramidas.TitaniumBackup\">Titanium Backup</a> which can only work properly if given root access. When you run an OS that allows root access you can run “<b>su -</b>” at a terminal prompt and you can also have an application use a GUI to request root access.</p>\n<p>I recommend rooting and modding an Android phone immediately after buying it. However that takes some time which is somewhat equivalent to money and is a significant hidden cost to purchasing an Android phone.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://play.android.com/details?id=net.rgruet.android.g3watchdog\"><img src=\"http://www.coker.com.au/blogpics/2012/and/a3gwatchdog.png\" alt=\"picture of 3g watchdog bandwidth monitor\" height=\"480px\" width=\"800px\"></a></p>\n<p>The business models of telephone companies seem to involve hidding users for unexpected fees and extra fees for excess bandwidth can be really expensive. <a href=\"https://play.android.com/details?id=net.rgruet.android.g3watchdog\">3G Watchdog</a> is one app that can monitor bandwidth and disable data transfers if too much is used. <a href=\"https://play.android.com/details?id=com.onavo.android.onavoid\">Onavo is an alternative that allows tracking data use on a per-application basis</a>, but it only runs on Android 2.3.x while 3G Watchdog works on Android 2.1.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://play.android.com/details?id=com.ebay.mobile\"><img src=\"http://www.coker.com.au/blogpics/2012/and/aebay.png\" alt=\"Official EBay app searching for Samsung Android phones\" height=\"480px\" width=\"800px\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://play.android.com/details?id=com.ebay.mobile\">EBay has an official app</a> which is handy for searching for items.

One significant advantage of OSM over the Google Maps is that OSM is free, the data is all contributed by users – like Wikipedia. Another significant advantage is that you can download as much data as you need to your phone, for example the entire dataset for Australia is about 200M. Storing 200M of data on your phone is no big deal when you consider the availability of phones with more than 16G of storage and the ability to use a map when offline is a real benefit.</p>\n<p>So far I’ve used Osmand while waiting for a train at an underground station and I plan to use it to track my progress the next time I’m on a cruise.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.servalproject\"><img src=\"http://www.coker.com.au/blogpics/2012/and/aserval.png\" alt=\"serval mesh networking and VOIP\" height=\"800px\" width=\"480px\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.servalproject\">Serval is a mesh networking application for Android that supports VOIP phone calls and distributing messages and files</a>.

This release is full of goodies, and as usual we’d like to give you a small tour through the new features, though we can’t possible cover all of them in one blog post.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://labs.qt.nokia.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/taskicons1.png\"><img src=\"http://labs.qt.nokia.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/taskicons1.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"Icons for build errors and C++11 support\" width=\"533\" height=\"399\"></a>The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B11\">C++11</a> standard was published last September. We are happy that Qt Creator 2.5 understands more of C++11 e.g. nullptr, constexpr, static_assert, noexcept, inline namespaces, auto, and partially lambda. And as usual we implemented some new refactoring operations, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A basic refactoring action to insert an #include for an undefined identifier</li>\n<li>A “extract function” refactoring action</li>\n<li>A “rearrange parameter list” refactoring action</li>\n<li>Signature synchronization: changing parameter names in the declaration automatically changes them in the function body</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The debuggers used on Linux and MinGW also pretty print some of the new C++11 types, such as std::shared_ptr, std::unique_ptr, std::array. In addition pretty printers for std::complex, boost::posix_time::{ptime,time_duration}, boost::gregorian::date are new in Qt Creator 2.5. Also more often than before, Qt Creator figures out the correct dynamic type of your pointers and thus pretty prints using the dynamic type.</p>\n<p>One day before the <a title=\"2.4 beta\" href=\"http://labs.qt.nokia.com/2011/10/20/qt-creator-2-4-0-beta-released/\">2.4 beta</a> was released <a title=\"Open Governance\" href=\"http://labs.qt.nokia.com/2011/10/21/the-qt-project-is-live/\">Open Governance</a> launched. Since then, 78 people used <a href=\"http://codereview.qt-project.org\">Codereview</a> to submit patches to Qt Creator. That’s great and shows the power and ease of use of gerrit. If you haven’t used gerrit yet, it’s a tremendous improvement to gitorious. It takes a few commands to <a href=\"http://wiki.qt-project.org/Setting_up_Gerrit\">set up gerrit</a> but afterwards publishing a patch for review is just one git push away, but don’t forget to add reviewers to your change.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://labs.qt.nokia.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/todoscreenshot3.png\"><img src=\"http://labs.qt.nokia.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/todoscreenshot3.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"TODO plugin\" width=\"533\" height=\"344\"></a>One of the big contributions to 2.5 is a TODO plugin. It is still lacking some polish so it is disabled by default, though it is already quite useable. Please give it a try by enabling it in Help/About Plugins. Many thanks to Dmitry and Vasiliy. We would like to thank everyone that contributed to Qt Creator and like especially highlight the good work that Orgad does, not only did he contribute over 30 commits to this release but he’s also the most active bug reporter apart from our QA team. In fact, he found a crash just hours before the beta release.</p>\n<p>Apart from those big features, 2.5 also includes lots of <em>small</em> features, to mention just two:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A clipboard history, use Ctrl+Shift+V to cycle</li>\n<li>Showing small icons for build errors in the editor margin and updating the line numbers of build errors while editing. See the screenshot above.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And then, before I forget, check out the previous blogs on <a href=\"http://labs.qt.nokia.com/2012/03/01/debugging-qt-quick-2-console-api/\">Debugging Qt Quick 2 – Console API</a> and <a href=\"http://labs.qt.nokia.com/2012/02/07/qml-profiler-update/\">QML Profiler update</a> .</p>\n<p>For even more information on the changes in 2.5, see the <a href=\"https://qt.gitorious.org/qt-creator/qt-creator/blobs/2.5/dist/changes-2.5.0\">changelog</a>.</p>\n<p>You can download Qt Creator from <a href=\"http://qt-project.org/wiki/Qt_Creator_Releases\">http://qt-project.org/wiki/Qt_Creator_Releases</a></p>\n<p>We appreciate any bug reports, feedback, patches via the <a href=\"http://lists.qt-project.org/mailman/listinfo/qt-creator\">mailing list</a>, the <a href=\"https://bugreports.qt-project.org/\">bug tracker</a>, <a href=\"http://codereview.qt-project.org/\">gerrit</a> and the #qt-creator IRC channel on freenode.</p>"

      "content" : "<p>The users of a hundred programming languages would like to call your low-level code, but they can’t.</p>\n<p>Things have changed in the last 20 years. More people are using languages like Python, Ruby, and a hundred more, that are further from the bare metal. People are building service stacks that tie together many lower-level functions.</p>\n<p>Libraries and APIs that make low-level features available to convenient high-level languages (HLLs) are a good thing. <a href=\"http://xkcd.com/353/\">As a HL coder, it’s pretty handy to install python-foo, type “import foo” and then have access to that functionality</a>.</p>\n<p>What if python-foo isn’t there? HLL users are out of luck, unless they are so determined they make their own python-foo that calls system(), and then parses the output using their language’s fancy text parsing features.</p>\n<p>But system() is the devil. We hate system(), folks. If your code calls system() it’s bad, for four reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Overhead. It creates a new process and subshell.</li>\n<li>Security. If your code has elevated privileges and is including text input by an untrusted user, watch out. <a href=\"http://xkcd.com/327/\">Remember little Bobby Tables</a>, a semicolon is a dangerous thing.</li>\n<li>Ease. Parsing command-line programs’ output can be a pain, even if your language helps lessen it. Parsing of errors is even harder and prone to be overlooked.</li>\n<li>Portability. A different platform may (or may not) have the program you’re relying on, or its output may be different, and you won’t know.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Early on when I was learning Python, I tried to write a gui for <a href=\"http://oprofile.sourceforge.net/news/\">OProfile</a> by parsing its output. OProfile did nice (for the user) things like adding headers on its output, and changing the format of output depending on what it found. Great for users, but it doomed my project. I couldn’t parse the output reliably.</p>\n<p>You want to make it easy for the people who are language gurus for each of the hundred languages out there to wrap your functionality <em>without</em> having to become an expert in your code, or even change it. Then the hordes using all the hundred languages can use your library without being an expert in your code <em>or</em> being enough of a guru in their language to write a wrapper. They can just happily use it.</p>\n<p>Here’s a positive development, <a href=\"http://git.kernel.org/?p=utils/kernel/kmod/kmod.git;a=summary\">kmod</a>. kmod is a new implementation of the utilities in module-init-tools: modprobe, lsmod, lsmod, etc. Not only does kmod include a libkmod C library, but the commandline programs use it, so we know it works. Yeah! This made it super easy for someone (me) to come along and write a language wrapper (<a href=\"https://github.com/agrover/python-kmod\">python-kmod</a>) without having to know about module internals. python-kmod makes it easy for Python users to manipulate modules using the friendly language features they’re used to, like exceptions for errors, and lists. If I had been forced to use system(), it probably would have <em>mostly</em> worked, but it would have failed when output parsing failed for some edge case.</p>\n<p>I encourage all low-level program writers, my fellow Linux Plumbers, to consider how to make native language bindings possible for your code. You don’t have to <em>write</em> them, just make them possible and you will find all sorts of people calling your code, safely, who couldn’t before.</p>"

      "content" : "In a <a href=\"http://paulmck.livejournal.com/31285.html\">recent post</a>, I called out some of the past year's activity in the area of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transactional_memory\" rel=\"nofollow\">transactional memory (TM)</a>.  This post takes a closer look at <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_transactional_memory\" rel=\"nofollow\">hardware transactional memory (HTM)</a>, with an eye to where it might fit into the parallel programmer's toolbox.<br><br><p>But first, what is HTM?<br></p><p>Current HTM implementations make use of processor caches and speculative execution to ensure that a designated group of statements (called a “transaction”) executes atomically from the viewpoint of any other transaction.  The beginning and end of a transaction is marked by begin-transaction and commit-transaction machine instructions, respectively, and might also include abort-transaction instructions.  The transaction is executed within the confines of its CPU, so that its work is not visible to other CPUs until the commit-transaction instruction is executed.  An abort-transaction instruction squashes the speculative execution, discarding any changes that the transaction might have carried out, while also branching to a failure handler.  The location of the failure handler is normally specified by the begin-transaction instruction, either as an explicit address or by means of condition codes.  This failure handler might then either: (1) retry the transaction, (2) execute a fallback code sequence, for example, using locking, or (3) otherwise handle the transaction's failure.  In this way, each transaction either executes atomically with respect to all other transactions, or is aborted with no changes to shared state.<br></p><p>So where does HTM fit into the parallel programmer's toolbox?  Ideally, we would like a classification of the applicability of HTM similar to that shown for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read-copy-update\" rel=\"nofollow\">RCU</a> in the diagram below:<br></p><p><a href=\"http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/paulmck/Answers/RCU/RCUAreaApp.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"Best for read-mostly data where inconsistency is tolerated\" height=\"280\" src=\"http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/paulmck/Answers/RCU/RCUApplicability.png\" width=\"520\"></a><br></p><p>On the other hand, I have been developing, using, and maintaining RCU in production for almost two decades.  Because the oldest commercially available HTM implementation is still quite young by comparison, any attempt to similarly classify its use must necessarily rely on educated guesses, extrapolation, and speculation.  But I am most certainly not going to let that stop me from making a first attempt! :-)<br></p><p>The remainder of this posting will look at a number of questions that need to be asked of current commercially available HTM implementations, but without focusing on any particular implementation.  The answers will be primarily about HTM in the publicly documented here-and-now, though some additional speculation about possible future implementations will inevitably leak in.  This additional speculation will draw on selected academic research projects.<br><br></p><h3>Does HTM Belong In The Parallel Programmer's Toolbox?</h3><br><p>The first question we need to ask is whether HTM has any place at all in the parallel programmer's toolbox.  After all, as the new entrant, it must prove its worth compared to any number of concurrency-control mechanisms that have been in production use for decades.  In addition, there has been no shortage of technologies that have roused great excitement but eventually failed of their promise, a historical tendency that is greatly illuminated by <a href=\"http://medicine.plosjournals.org/perlserv?request=get-document&amp;doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ioannidis's Sixth Corrollary</a>.<br></p><p>Ioannidis notwithstanding, it seems quite likely that the answer to this first question is in the affirmative.  To quote <a href=\"http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1842733.1842749\" rel=\"nofollow\">Why The Grass May Not Be Greener On The Other Side: A Comparison of Locking vs. Transactional Memory</a>, “An important TM near-term opportunity is thus update-heavy workloads using large non-partitionable data structures such as high-diameter unstructured graphs.” (Disclaimer: I co-authored this paper, which is a revision of the <a href=\"http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1376789.1376798\" rel=\"nofollow\">2007 PLOS paper by the same name</a> with revised presentation <a href=\"http://www.rdrop.com/users/paulmck/scalability/paper/TMevalSlides.2008.10.19a.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.) Although there are other mechanisms that can be used to handle large update-heavy non-partitionable data structures, these other methods suffer from cache-locality problems.  There is thus hope that HTM can provide performance advantages in this area.  In addition, use of HTM for transactional lock elision promises to greatly reduce the number of cache misses associated with lock acquisition and release, which is likely to provide large performance advantages to HTM for short lock-based critical sections—at least in cases where none of the oft-written variables protected by the elided lock share a cache line with that lock.<br><br></p><h3>Should HTM Be Used Universally?</h3><br><p>Given that HTM very likely has a place in the parallel programmer's toolbox, the logical next question to ask is whether parallel programmers can simplify their lives by just using HTM for everything.<br></p><p>The answer to this question is an emphatic “no” for the following reasons:<br></p><ol><br><li>\tHTM is unable to handle non-idempotent operations, such as <a href=\"http://paulmck.livejournal.com/10539.html\">unbuffered I/O</a> (especially things like <a href=\"http://paulmck.livejournal.com/10912.html\">remote procedure calls</a>) and system calls including <a href=\"http://paulmck.livejournal.com/11245.html\">memory mapping</a> and <a href=\"http://paulmck.livejournal.com/13370.html\">exec()</a>.  This limitation appears to be inherent to HTM.<br></li><li>\tHTM limits maximum transaction size.  <a href=\"http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/paulmck/Answers/TransactionalMemoryEverywhere/WhyHTMSizeLim.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">So why do current commercially available HTM implementations limit transaction size and what can be done about it?</a><br></li><li>\tHTM currently lacks forward-progress guarantees.  <a href=\"http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/paulmck/Answers/TransactionalMemoryEverywhere/WhyHTMNoFwdProg.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">So why do current commercially available HTM implementations lack forward-progress guarantees?</a><br></li><li>\tEven with forward-progress guarantees, HTM is subject to aborts and rollbacks, which (aside from wasting energy) are failure paths.  Failure code paths are in my experience difficult to work with.  The possibility of failure is not handled particularly well by human brain cells, which are programmed for optimism.  Failure code paths also pose difficulties for validation, particularly in cases where the probability of failure is low or in cases where multiple failures are required to reach a given code path.<br></li><li>\tHTM is subject to thorny validation issues, including the inability to usefully set breakpoints in or single-step through transaction.  In addition, although transactional lock elision might greatly reduce the probability of deadlock, the fact that the fallback code might be executed means that fallback-code deadlock cannot be ignored.  Finally, in many cases the fallback code will be invoked quite infrequently, which might allow fallback-code bugs (including performance problems involving high levels of lock contention) to escape detection during validation, thus inflicting themselves on users.  Use of HTM will therefore likely require painstaking attention at validation time, and also tools to detect deadlock and exercise fallback code.<br></li><li>\tThere are subtle semantic differences between locking and transactional lock elision.  One example is interactions with outside accesses as <a href=\"http://www.cis.upenn.edu/acg/papers/wddd05_atomic_semantics.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">shown by Blundell et al</a>.  Another example is the empty lock-based critical section, which waits for all prior critical sections for locking, but is a no-op when all concurrent lock-based critical sections have been elided in favor of HTM execution.  This use of locking as a message-passing mechanism can also be used in non-empty critical sections. (More on this <a href=\"http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/paulmck/Answers/TransactionalMemoryEverywhere/WhyEmptyLock.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.)<br></li></ol><br><p>We can see that HTM is useful on the one hand, but has substantial limitations on the other.  Therefore, the next section looks at where HTM is most likely to be helpful.<br><br></p><h3>Where is HTM Most Likely to be Helpful?</h3><br><p>HTM is likely to be at its best for large in-memory data structures that are difficult to statically partition but that are dynamically partitionable, in other words, the conflict probability is reasonably low.  There must be a reasonable non-TM fallback algorithm for every transaction.  The workload should ideally be update-heavy with small accesses and updates, and not subject to aggressive real-time constraints.  Finally, if HTM is used for transactional lock elision, any empty critical sections must continue to use explicit locking.<br></p><p><a href=\"http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/paulmck/Answers/TransactionalMemoryEverywhere/WhyHTMOpt.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Why is this situation best for HTM?</a><br></p><p>A thought experiment involving a red-black tree might be helpful.<br></p><p>First, consider a red-black tree that supports insertions, deletions, and lookups of single elements, but where all of these APIs return the exact number of elements in the tree.  In this case, the resulting transactions will be very prone to conflicts on the variable in which the element count is maintained, resulting in poor performance and scalability, especially for update-heavy workloads.<br></p><p>This should not be surprising, because returning the size causes insertion and deletion to be <a href=\"http://lwn.net/Articles/423994\" rel=\"nofollow\">strongly non-commutative</a>.  Maintaining and returning a consistent count is simply bad for parallelism.<br></p><p>Therefore, let's next consider a red-black tree with insertion, deletion, and lookup, but without the exact count of the number of elements in the tree.  In this case, if the tree is large, the conflict probabilities between random insertion, deletion, and lookup operations is extremely low.  In this case, HTM is likely to perform and scale quite well.<br></p><p>Finally, let's add an API that enumerates all the the nodes in the red-black tree.  A transaction implementing this API will conflict with all concurrent insertion or deletion operations, severely limiting performance and scalability.  In many cases, this situation can be alleviated by using hazard pointers or RCU to protect these large read-only accesses.  Although the RCU/hazard-pointer reader can still conflict with updates, the conflict window is now limited to each single read-side load, instead of extending across the entire read-side operation, as is the case for transactions. (RCU and hazard pointers could help even more if their loads didn't generate conflicts, but instead returned the old value of any variable written by an in-flight transaction, but current HTM implementations do not appear to do this.)<br></p><p>This last example illustrates the importance of using combinations of synchronization mechanisms in ways that play to each mechanism's strengths.<br><br></p><h3>Summary</h3><br><p>In summary, although it appears that HTM will be able to earn a place in the parallel programmer's toolbox, it is not a magic wand with which to wish away all concurrency problems.  Like every other tool in the toolbox, it will be necessary to carefully consider whether HTM is the right tool for a particular job.  Furthermore, like every other tool in the toolbox, it may in some cases be necessary to tune, restructure, or even redesign your code in order to obtain the full benefits of HTM.<br></p><p>HTM should therefore be an interesting and exciting learning experience for all concerned.  ;-)<br></p><p>(Thanks to a great number of people, especially Jon Walpole, Josh Triplett, and Andi Kleen for a number of illuminating discussions on TM in general and HTM in particular.)</p>"

      "content" : "<p align=\"justify\">The Qt HTTP stack is the base for any HTTP communication with Qt; it is for instance used by the <a href=\"http://trac.webkit.org/wiki/QtWebKit\">Qt Webkit port</a>. In Qt 5, quite a bit of the HTTP internals have been rewritten, mostly by <a href=\"http://woboq.com/\">Markus from woboq</a>. This blog post is trying to shed some light on the HTTP internals, even though some classes are omitted here for simplicity.<br>\nTo start with, the public classes can be used as follows.</p>\n\n\n\n<br><br>\n<p><big><big><b>Simple example code</b></big></big></p>\n<pre>QUrl url(\"http://qt.gitorious.org\");\nQNetworkRequest request(url);\nQNetworkAccessManager manager;\nQNetworkReply *reply = manager.get(request);\nQObject::connect(reply, SIGNAL(finished()), myClass, SLOT(replyFinished()));\n</pre>\n\n\n\n<br><br>\n<p><big><big><b>1. The public classes and their friends</b></big></big></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The example shows the main classes: A <strong>QUrl</strong> is used to create a <strong>QNetworkRequest</strong>, which resembles an HTTP request. The request is then passed to the <strong>QNetworkAccessManager</strong>, which sends the request over the network and returns a <strong>QNetworkReply</strong>, which resembles an HTTP reply. Depending on the scheme of the URL, the <strong>QNetworkAccessManager</strong> instantiates an internal subclass of <strong>QNetworkReply</strong>; in the case of a URL scheme of 'http://' or 'https://', the class instantiated is called <strong>QNetworkReplyHttpImpl</strong>. This class is the main class for setting up the request and \"enriching\" it with additional data like caching or cookie information before sending the request.<br>\nIn case the request is supposed to upload data, (i.e. when using HTTP POST or PUT), the HTTP impl class uses a <strong>QNonContiguousByteDevice</strong>. Such a non contiguous byte device can be used to read from a file, byte array or others without expensive memcpy'ing.<br>\nThis looks like the following in UML notation:\n\n<br><br>\n<img alt=\"qt-http-1.jpg\" src=\"http://peter.hartmann.tk/blog/qt-http-internals/qt-http-1.jpg\" width=\"360\" height=\"396\">\n</p>\n\n\n\n<br><br>\n<p><big><big><b>2. The worker thread</b></big></big></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">One feature that was introduced in Qt 4.8 was a threaded HTTP backend: This new backend executes the sending and receiving of data over the sockets and the HTTP message parsing in its own thread (see also the <a href=\"http://labs.qt.nokia.com/2011/04/29/threaded-http-inside-qnetworkaccessmanager/\">blog post</a> about the change).<br>\nThe <strong>QNetworkReplyHttpImpl</strong> creates a class that lives in the new thread, the so-called HTTP thread. This class is called <strong>QHttpThreadDelegate</strong>, and serves as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facade_pattern\">Facade</a> class for everything that is going on in the HTTP thread. The cross-thread communication between <strong>QNetworkReplyHttpImpl</strong> and <strong>QHttpThreadDelegate</strong> happens through signals and slots communication, and data travels both ways. This means that both the Delegate has slots which are invoked by signals emitted in the HttpImpl and vice versa.<br>\nWhenever a <strong>QNetworkReplyHttpImpl</strong> is created, it creates a corresponding <strong>QHttpThreadDelegate</strong>, connects signals and slots and moves the Delegate to the HTTP thread.<br>\nThe Delegate contains classes that resemble the HTTP request and reply, namely <strong>QHttpNetworkRequest</strong> and <strong>QHttpNetworkReply</strong>. This might be a bit confusing, since there are already the public <strong>QNetworkRequest</strong> and <strong>QNetworkReply</strong>; the latter classes are public interfaces for many of the HTTP specific attributes of the request and reply, e.g. set HTTP pipelining setting, status code or other other HTTP headers. The internal classes <strong>QHttpNetworkRequest</strong> and <strong>QHttpNetworkReply</strong> parse the HTTP message into header fields and body from the socket data stream.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">With those new classes added to the diagram, it looks as follows.</p>\n<br><br>\n\n<img alt=\"qt-http-2.jpg\" src=\"http://peter.hartmann.tk/blog/qt-http-internals/qt-http-2.jpg\" width=\"770\" height=\"391\">\n\n\n\n<br><br>\n<p><big><big><b>3. The lower layers</b></big></big></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The HTTP requests and replies are sent and received over so-called channels; a channel is basically a socket with a bit more logic for state handling and HTTP features. The socket of a channel can be a <strong>QTcpSocket</strong> for a normal HTTP request, or it can be a <strong>QSslSocket</strong> in case a 'https://' scheme is used.<br>\nA set of channels connected to the same server form a connection. There is always only one connection to a server, but up to 6 channels used concurrently. In addition, there can be even more requests on the fly if HTTP pipelining is enabled. When a reply has been received over a socket, the latter is not automatically closed, but by default reused for later requests, to save socket setup time and to already have a socket with a larger TCP window size.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Now the UML diagram of the HTTP stack is almost complete:</p>\n<br><br>\n\n<img alt=\"qt-http-3.jpg\" src=\"http://peter.hartmann.tk/blog/qt-http-internals/qt-http-3.jpg\" width=\"806\" height=\"737\">\n\n\n<br><br>\n<p><big><big><b>4. The rest</b></big></big></p>\n<p>Two classes have not been mentioned yet, even though they are of importance:\n</p><ul align=\"justify\">\n    <li><strong>QNetworkSession</strong>: This class is used mostly for mobile use cases, when there is no permanent connection to the Internet. In case there is no connection to the Internet, the <strong>QNetworkSession</strong> and related classes will try to establish a connection (e.g. an application would connect to a signal by the <strong>QNetworkSession</strong> and let the user choose between 3G and Wifi). The session is instantiated by the <strong>QNetworkAccessManager</strong>.</li>\n    <li><strong>QNetworkAccessAuthenticationManager</strong>: This is a global class for storing authentication credentials that need to be reused. If a server requires authentication, the network access manager emits a signal (QNetworkAccessManager::authenticationRequired()) which should trigger the user to enter his user name and password. The authentication manager class caches that data and sends it automatically to the server with subsequent requests. Interestingly, the authentication manager also uses a <strong>QNetworkAccessCache</strong>, just like the <strong>QHttpNetworkConnection</strong> does to cache connections.</li>\n</ul>\n<p align=\"justify\">So the (for the scope of this article) complete diagram of the Qt HTTP stack looks like the following:</p>\n<br><br>\n\n\n<img alt=\"qt-http.jpg\" src=\"http://peter.hartmann.tk/blog/qt-http-internals/qt-http.jpg\" width=\"806\" height=\"737\">\n\n\n\n<br><br>\n<p><big><big><b>What has not been mentioned</b></big></big></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Even though the diagram above seems to be complicated enough, there are several classes and areas that have been omitted, namely:\n</p><ul align=\"justify\">\n    <li><strong>Bearer classes</strong>: In order to tweak connection setup etc. more closely, there are several classes beyond the aforementioned <strong>QNetworkSession</strong>.</li>\n    <li><strong>Cookies</strong>: Of course cookie parsing and sending is by default supported by the Qt HTTP stack; see the classes <strong>QNetworkCookie</strong> and <strong>QNetworkCookieJar</strong>.</li>\n    <li><strong>HTTP caching</strong>: Qt also supports HTTP caching; however, it is not enabled by default.</li>\n    <li><strong>Proxies</strong>: Qt supports network transfer over HTTP and SOCKS5 proxies.</li>\n    <li><strong>uploading data</strong>: Some classes related to uploading data have been omitted, among others classes for handling HTTP multipart messages.</li>\n</ul>"

    "alternate" : [ {
      "href" : "http://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/9844.html",
      "type" : "text/html"
    } ],
    "summary" : {
      "direction" : "ltr",
      "content" : "I wrote about the <a href=\"http://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/6054.html\">technical details</a> of supporting the UEFI secure boot specification with Linux. Despite me pretty clearly saying that this was ignoring issues of licensing and key distribution and the like, people are now using it to claim that Linux could support secure boot with minimal effort. In a sense, they're right. The technical implementation details are fairly straightforward. But they're not the difficult bit.<br><h3>Secure boot requires that all code that can touch hardware be trusted</h3>Right now, if you can run unstrusted code before the OS then you can subvert the OS. Secure boot gives you a mechanism for making sure you only run trusted code, which protects against that. So your UEFI drivers have to be signed, your bootloader has to be signed, and your bootloader must only load a signed kernel. If you've only booted trusted code then you know that your OS is safe. But, unlike trusted boot, secure boot provides no way for you to know that only trusted code was executed. That has to be ensured by OS policy.<br><br>This doesn't sound like too much of a problem. But it is. Imagine we have a signed Linux bootloader and a signed Linux kernel, and that these signatures are made with a globally trusted key. These will boot on any hardware using secure boot. Now imagine that an attacker writes a kernel module that sets up a fake UEFI environment, stops the kernel from running code and then executes the Windows bootloader - kind of like kexec, but a little more fiddly. The Windows bootloader believes that it's performing a secure boot, but in fact everything that it believes is trustworthy is the attacker's fake UEFI code. The user's encryption passphrase is logged, the Windows kernel is modified to hide the Linux code and despite everything looking fine your credit card details are on their way to China. In this scenario, the signed Linux kernel is simply used as a malware loader. The only sign that anything is wrong is that boot will be slightly slowed down.<br><br>Signing the kernel isn't enough. Signed Linux kernels must refuse to load any unsigned kernel modules. Virtualbox on Linux? Dead. Nvidia binary driver on Linux? Dead. All out of tree kernel modules? Utterly, utterly dead. Building an updated driver locally? Not going to happen. That's going to make some people fairly unhappy.<br><br>(The same applies to Windows, of course. Windows 7 allows you to disable driver integrity checks. Windows 8 will have to forbid that when the system's using secure boot)<br><h3>Licensing</h3>GPLv3 has various requirements for signing keys to be available. Microsoft's new requirement that systems support the installation of user keys would let users boot their own modified bootloaders, so that may end up being sufficient to satisfy the license. But we're then beholden on Microsoft - if they remove that requirement then users lose that freedom, and suddenly we're in an awkward licensing situation. There are ongoing conversations about exactly what we're able to do here, but it's not a solved problem.<br><h3>Key distribution</h3>The UEFI spec doesn't describe or mandate a central certifying authority. Microsoft require that everyone carry their key. We could generate our own, but we have much less sway with vendors. There's no way to guarantee that all hardware vendors will generate our key. And, obviously, if we generate a key, we can't just hand the private half out to others. That means that it becomes impossible for people to produce derivative versions of Linux distributions without getting their own key. The kind of identity verification that would be required for getting such a key is likely to be expensive, and also fairly likely to require that the distribution have a legally registered company in order to facilitate the identity verification. Think Extended Validation certificates, not Startssl Free. Hobbyist Linux distributions will be a thing of the past.<br><h3>Doesn't custom mode fix this?</h3>Microsoft's certification requirements now state that all systems must support a custom mode, implying that it will be possible for a user to install their own keys. Linux vendors would then be able to ship with their own keys on the install media and impose their own policies. Everyone's happy. It's not really good enough, though. People have spent incredible amounts of time and effort making it easy to install Linux by doing little more than putting a CD in a drive. Asking them to go into the firmware and reconfigure things adds an extra barrier that restricts the ability to install Linux to more technically skilled users. And it's even worse than that. This is the full description of the requirement for custom mode:<cite><ol><li>It shall be possible for a physically present user to use the Custom Mode firmware setup option to modify the contents of the Secure Boot signature databases and the PK.<br></li><li>If the user ends up deleting the PK then, upon exiting the Custom Mode firmware setup, the system will be operating in Setup Mode with Secure Boot turned off.<br></li><li>The firmware setup shall indicate if Secure Boot is turned on, and if it is operated in Standard or Custom Mode. The firmware setup must provide an option to return from Custom to Standard Mode which restores the factory defaults.</li></ol></cite><br>There's a few things missing from this, namely:<br><ul><li>Any description of the UI. It's effectively impossible to document Linux installation when the first step becomes (a) complicated and (b) vendor specific. Vendors are using the UEFI transition to differentiate themselves by coming up with their own unique firmware interfaces. Custom mode is going to look different everywhere.</li><li>Any description of the key format. A raw binary representation of the key? An EFI_SIGNATURE_DATA struct? A base64 encoding of one, further protected with ROT13? We just don't know.</li><li>Any way to use custom mode for unattended installs. It's a firmware interface that requires a physically present user. Want to install a few thousand machines over the network? This isn't a scalable approach</li><li>…and this one's nitpicking, but there's not actually any requirement that the user be able to add keys - a vendor could conform to this language by only letting users delete keys. This is actually ok as long as the user deletes Pk, because then we'll effectively be back in setup mode and can install our own keys from the installer, but it still results in some practical problems</li></ul><br>So no, custom mode doesn't make everything ok. Custom mode with a mandated UI and a documented key format would be much closer, but it wouldn't solve the problem of unattended automated installs.<br><h3>Summary</h3>We can write the code required to support secure boot on Linux in a minimal amount of time - in fact, most of it's now done. But significant practical problems remain, and so far we have no workable solutions for any of them.<br><br><img alt=\"comment count unavailable\" height=\"12\" src=\"http://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=mjg59&amp;ditemid=9844\" style=\"vertical-align:middle\" width=\"30\"> comments"

      "content" : "<p>There has been a lot of discussion recently about the recent Microsoft ideas regarding secure boot, in case you have missed it <a href=\"http://ncommander.blogspot.com/2011/11/secure-boot-its-here-and-been-here-for.html\">Michael Casadevall has written a good summary of the issue [1]</a>.</p>\n<p>Recently I’ve seen a couple of people advocate the concept of secure boot with the stated idea that “root” should be unable to damage the system, as Microsoft Software is something that doesn’t matter to me I’ll restrict my comments to how this might work on Linux.</p>\n<p>Restricting the “root” account is something that is technically possible, for much of the past 9 years I have been running <a href=\"http://www.coker.com.au/selinux/play.html\">SE Linux “Play Machines” which have UID 0 (root) restricted by SE Linux such that they can’t damage the system [2]</a> – there are other ways of achieving similar goals. But having an account with UID 0 that can’t change anything on the system doesn’t really match what most people think of as “root”, I just do it as a way of demonstrating that SE Linux controls all access such that cracking a daemon which runs as root won’t result in immediately controlling the entire system.</p>\n<p>As an aside my Play Machine is not online at the moment, I hope to have it running again soon.</p>\n<h3>Root Can’t Damage the System</h3>\n<p>One specific claim was that “root” should be unable to damage the system. While a secure boot system can theoretically result in a boot to single user mode without any compromise that doesn’t apply to fully operational systems. For a file owned by root to be replaced the system security has to be compromised in some way. The same compromise will usually work every time until the bug is fixed and the software is upgraded. So the process of cracking root that might be used to install hostile files can also be used at runtime to exploit running processes via ptrace and do other bad stuff.</p>\n<p>Even if the attacker is forced to compromise the system at every boot this isn’t a great win for the case of servers with months of uptime or for the case of workstations that have confidential data that can be rapidly copied over the Internet. There are also many workstations that are live on the Internet for months nowadays.</p>\n<p>Also the general claim doesn’t really make sense on it’s own. “root” usually means the account that is used for configuring the system. If a system can be configured then the account which is used to configure it will be able to do unwanted things. It is theoretically possible to run workstations without external root access (EG have them automatically update to the latest security fixes). Such a workstation configuration MIGHT be able to survive a compromise by having a reboot trigger an automatic update. But a workstation that is used in such a manner could be just re-imaged as it would probably be used in an environment where data-less operation makes sense.</p>\n<p>An Android phone could be considered as an example of a Linux system for which the “root” user can’t damage the system if you consider “root” to mean “person accessing the GUI configuration system”. But then it wouldn’t be difficult to create a configuration program for a regular Linux system that allows the user to change some parts of the system configuration while making others unavailable. Besides there are many ways in which the Android configuration GUI permits the user to make the system mostly unusable (EG by disabling data access) or extremely expensive to operate (EG by forcing data roaming). So I don’t think that Android is a good example of “root” being prevented from doing damage.</p>\n<h3>Signing All Files</h3>\n<p>Another idea that I saw advocated was to have the “secure boot” concept extended to all files. So you have a boot loader that loads a signed kernel which then loads only signed executables and then every interpreter (Perl, Python, etc) will also check for signatures on files that they run. This would be tricky with interpreters that are designed to run from standard input (most notably /bin/sh but also many other interpreters).</p>\n<p>Doing this would require changing many programs, I guess you would even have to change mount to check the signature on /etc/fstab etc. This would be an unreasonably large amount of work.</p>\n<p>Another possibility would be to change the kernel such that it checks file signatures and has restrictions on system calls such as open() and the exec() family of calls. In concept it would be possible to extend SE Linux or any other access control system to include access checks on which files need to be signed (some types such as etc_t and bin_t would need to be signed but others such as var_t wouldn’t).</p>\n<p>Of course this would mean that no sysadmin work could be performed locally as all file changes would have to come from the signing system. I can imagine all sorts of theoretically interesting but practically useless ways of implementing this such as having the signing system disconnected from the Internet with USB flash devices used for one-way file transfer – because you can’t have the signing system available to the same attacks as the host system.</p>\n<p>The requirement to sign all files would reduce the use of such a system to a tiny fraction of the user-base. Which would then raise the question of why anyone would spend the effort on that task when there are so many other ways of improving security that involve less work and can be used by more people.</p>\n<h3>Encrypted Root Filesystem</h3>\n<p>One real benefit of a secure boot system is for systems using encrypted filesystems. It would be good to know that a hostile party hasn’t replaced the kernel and initrd when you are asked for the password to unlock the root filesystem. This would be good for the case where a laptop is left in a hotel room or other place where a hostile party could access it.</p>\n<p>Another way of addressing the same problem is to boot from a USB device so that you can keep a small USB boot device with you when it’s inconvenient to carry a large laptop (which works for me). Of course it’s theoretically possible for the system BIOS to be replaced with something that trojans the boot process (EG runs the kernel in a virtual machine). But I expect that if someone who is capable of doing that gets access to my laptop then I’m going to lose anyway.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>The secure boot concept does seem to have some useful potential when the aim is to reboot the system and have it automatically apply security fixes in the early stages of the boot process. This could be used for Netbooks and phones. Of course such a process would have to reset some configuration settings to safe defaults, this means replacing files in /etc and some configuration files in the user’s home directory. So such a reboot and upgrade procedure would either leave the possibility that files in /etc were still compromised or it would remove some configuration work and thus give the user an incentive to avoid applying the patch.</p>\n<p>Any system that tries to extend signature checks all the way would either be vulnerable to valid but hostile changes to system configuration (such as authenticating to a server run by a hostile party) or have extreme ease of use issues due to signing everything.</p>\n<p>Also a secure boot will only protect a vulnerable system between the time it is rebooted and the time it returns to full operation after the reboot. If the security flaw hasn’t been fixed (which could be due to a 0-day exploit or an exploit for which the patch hasn’t been applied) then the system could be cracked again.</p>\n<p>I don’t think that a secure boot process offers real benefits to many users.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>[1]<a href=\"http://ncommander.blogspot.com/2011/11/secure-boot-its-here-and-been-here-for.html\"> http://ncommander.blogspot.com/2011/11/secure-boot-its-here-and-been-here-for.html</a></li>\n<li>[2]<a href=\"http://www.coker.com.au/selinux/play.html\"> http://www.coker.com.au/selinux/play.html</a></li>\n</ul>"

When using Linux as a\nrouter, the inefficiency of the route cache can hinder the\nperformances of your box.</p>\n<p>The documentation on this component is scarce and it is difficult to\nfind up-to-date bits on how the route cache works and how to tune\nit. The book <em><a href=\"http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596002558.do\" title=\"Understanding Linux Network Internals\">Understanding Linux Network Internals</a></em>\nfrom O’Reilly is an exception and contains valuable information on how\nthe route cache works. Even if the book is targeted at 2.6.12, the\npart on the route cache is still quite accurate. Unfortunately, it\nfails to provide appropriate tips on how to monitor and tune the route cache.</p>\n<p>I hope to provide here a concise view of the route cache, as it is\nimplemented in <strong>Linux 3.1</strong>. It is protocol-dependent<sup><a href=\"http://vincent.bernat.im/en/blog/atom.xml#fn:dst\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup> and I\nwill cover only the <strong>IPv4</strong> version here.</p>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://vincent.bernat.im/en/blog/atom.xml#overview_of_the_route_cache_subsystem\">Overview of the route cache subsystem</a><ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://vincent.bernat.im/en/blog/atom.xml#available_knobs\">Available knobs</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://vincent.bernat.im/en/blog/atom.xml#statistics__monitoring\">Statistics <span>&amp;</span> monitoring</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://vincent.bernat.im/en/blog/atom.xml#tuning\">Tuning</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://vincent.bernat.im/en/blog/atom.xml#in-depth_look_into_the_garbage_collector\">In-depth look into the garbage collector</a><ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://vincent.bernat.im/en/blog/atom.xml#setting_a_goal\">Setting a goal</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://vincent.bernat.im/en/blog/atom.xml#meeting_the_goal\">Meeting the goal</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://vincent.bernat.im/en/blog/atom.xml#conclusion\">Conclusion</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h1>Overview of the route cache subsystem</h1>\n<p>To handle an incoming or outgoing <span>IP</span> datagram, the kernel needs to\nissue a lookup in the route tables. While it seems to be quite\ntrivial, several questions need to be answered:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Does the source address and the destination address appear to be valid?</li>\n<li>Is the source address a martian address<sup><a href=\"http://vincent.bernat.im/en/blog/atom.xml#fn:martian\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a></sup>?</li>\n<li>Is the destination address mine or should I forward the packet?</li>\n<li>Which route table should I use?</li>\n<li>Does the destination address match this route? And this one?</li>\n<li>Can I currently contact the gateway that I should use?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Those checks can be a bit time consuming, even for small route\ntables. To avoid them for each packets, Linux maintains a <em>route\ncache</em> which is queried before doing a regular lookup and updated\nafter each one. You can dump it with <code>ip -s route show cache</code>:</p>\n<div><pre><span>$</span> ip -s route show cache\n<span>198.51.100.7 from 203.0.113.2 via 192.0.2.1 dev eth1</span>\n<span>  cache used 7 age 2sec ipid 0x1fce rtt 131ms rttvar 45ms cwnd 10</span>\n<span>198.51.100.17 from 203.0.113.15 via 192.0.2.1 dev eth1</span>\n<span>  cache used 3 age 0sec ipid 0xc3bd</span>\n<span>local 192.0.2.18 from 203.0.113.15 dev lo src 192.0.2.18</span>\n<span>  cache &lt;local&gt; used 154 age 1sec iif eth0</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>Here are two examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If Linux receives a packet from <strong>198.51.100.17</strong> to\n   <strong>203.0.113.15</strong>, it will find this flow in the route\n   cache. Therefore, it already knows that it should forward the packet\n   to 192.0.2.1. No checks needed.</li>\n<li>If it receives a packet from <strong>198.51.100.16</strong> to <strong>203.0.113.15</strong>,\n   there is no appropriate entry in the route cache and therefore,\n   the system will have to look at the route tables. It is likely to\n   use the exact same entry than if the source was 198.51.100.17 but\n   maybe there is some policy routing requesting the use of a special\n   route table or 198.51.100.16 is a local address and the packet\n   will therefore be classified as <em>martian</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The schema below shows how this cache is implemented<sup><a href=\"http://vincent.bernat.im/en/blog/atom.xml#fn:src\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a></sup>. It uses a\nseparate <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table\" title=\"Hash table on Wikipedia\">hash table</a> (<span>BSD</span> systems keep the cache in the routing\ntable). Each bucket is a chained list of route cache entries.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://d1g3mdmxf8zbo9.cloudfront.net/images/linux/routing-cache.png\" alt=\"Schema of the route cache hash table\" title=\"Partial view of the route cache hash table with three cached entries\"></p>\n<p>Once an entry has been added to the route cache, there are several\nways to remove it. Most entries are removed by the\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)\" title=\"Garbage collector on Wikipedia\">garbage collector</a> which will scan the route cache and remove\ninvalid and older entries. It will be triggered when the route cache\nis full or at regular interval, once a certain threshold has been met.</p>\n<h2>Available knobs</h2>\n<p>There are several values you can tune. Most of them are available in\n<code>sysctl</code>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>rhash_entries</code> is the <strong>size of the hash table</strong><sup><a href=\"http://vincent.bernat.im/en/blog/atom.xml#fn:size\" rel=\"footnote\">4</a></sup>. If you\n   don’t specify it on the kernel command line, it is computed\n   dynamically based on the memory available on your system. You can\n   view its value by looking at something like <code>IP route cache hash\n   table entries: 262144 (order: 9, 2097152 bytes)</code> in the kernel logs.</li>\n<li><code>net.ipv4.route.max_size</code> is the <strong>maximum number of entries</strong> in\n   the route cache. Except under exceptional circumstances, this value\n   is never exceeded.</li>\n<li><code>net.ipv4.route.gc_elasticity</code> is the target <strong>average length of a\n   chain</strong> in the route cache. The garbage collector will work harder\n   if this value is exceeded. This means that if you multiply this\n   value by the value of <code>rhash_entries</code>, you will get the target\n   average number of entries in the route cache.</li>\n<li><code>net.ipv4.route.gc_min_interval_ms</code> is the <strong>minimum delay between\n   two runs of the garbage collector</strong>, except when the cache is\n   full. The default value should be fine.</li>\n<li><code>net.ipv4.route.gc_thresh</code> is a <strong>threshold triggering the garbage\n   collector</strong> every <code>net.ipv4.route.gc_min_interval_ms</code> milliseconds.</li>\n<li><code>net.ipv4.route.gc_timeout</code> is the base value to determine if an\n   <strong>entry is old enough to be removed</strong> or not. Whatever its value,\n   the garbage collector will attempt to remove the same number of\n   entries. However, this value could potentially influence its\n   efficiency. See below for more details on this.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You may find documentation about those obsolete <em>sysctl</em> values:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>net.ipv4.route.secret_interval</code> has been\n   <a href=\"https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/3ee943728fff536edaf8f59faa58aaa1aa7366e3\" title=\"Linux commit removing secret_interval timer\">removed in Linux 2.6.35</a>; it was used to trigger an\n   asynchronous flush at fixed interval to avoid to fill the cache.</li>\n<li><code>net.ipv4.route.gc_interval</code> has been\n   <a href=\"https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/349d2895cc8b7db1f5be677cd685209a3805d2ed\" title=\"Linux commit removing gc_interval sysctl\">removed in Linux 2.6.38</a>. It is still present until\n   Linux 3.2 but has no effect. It was used to trigger an asynchronous\n   cleanup of the route cache (but in a different way of what the\n   garbage collector does). The garbage collector is now considered\n   efficient enough for the job.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Statistics <span>&amp;</span> monitoring</h2>\n<p>Linux maintains some statistics about the use of the route\ncache. You can find them in <code>/proc/net/stat/rt_cache</code>. The command\n<code>lnstat</code> can print them nicely for you:</p>\n<div><pre><span>$</span> lnstat -s1 -i1 -c-1 -f rt_cache\n<span>rt_cache|rt_cache|rt_cache|rt_cache|rt_cache|rt_cache|rt_cache|rt_cache|rt_cache|rt_cache|rt_cache|rt_cache|rt_cache|rt_cache|rt_cache|rt_cache|rt_cache|</span>\n<span> entries|  in_hit|in_slow_|in_slow_|in_no_ro|  in_brd|in_marti|in_marti| out_hit|out_slow|out_slow|gc_total|gc_ignor|gc_goal_|gc_dst_o|in_hlist|out_hlis|</span>\n<span>        |        |     tot|      mc|     ute|        |  an_dst|  an_src|        |    _tot|     _mc|        |      ed|    miss| verflow| _search|t_search|</span>\n<span> 3096848|   42309|     686|       0|       0|       0|       0|       0|       3|       0|       0|     674|     672|       0|       0|   27644|       8|</span>\n<span> 3096984|   41405|     636|       0|       0|       0|       0|       0|       3|       0|       0|     623|     621|       0|       0|   28189|       8|</span>\n<span> 3097160|   42483|     700|       0|       0|       0|       0|       0|       5|       0|       0|     694|     692|       0|       0|   29506|      12|</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>Except for the first column, <code>lnstat</code> outputs values in units per\nsecond. Let’s review some of those values:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>rt_cache_entries</code> is the number of entries in the route cache. You\n   should compare it with <code>net.ipv4.route.max_size</code> and ensure that\n   the <strong>cache is never full</strong> to avoid triggering the garbage\n   collector too often.</li>\n<li><code>rt_cache_in_hit</code> and <code>rt_cache_out_hit</code> are the number of regular\n   lookups avoided because the result was found in the cache for\n   incoming and outgoing packets, respectively. When the system is a\n   router, most lookups only happen on the incoming side. You should\n   compare this value with <code>rt_cache_in_slow_tot</code> and\n   <code>rt_cache_in_out_slow_tot</code> which are the number of lookups in the\n   route tables. On this system, the <strong>efficiency</strong> of the route cache\n   is more than 98% which is quite good.</li>\n<li><code>rt_cache_gc_total</code> is how often the garbage collector was\n   requested to be triggered while <code>rt_cache_gc_ignored</code> corresponds\n   to how often it was finally not run because it has already been\n   triggered shortly beforehand (less than\n   <code>net.ipv4.route.gc_min_interval_ms</code> milliseconds). The difference\n   between those two values should be very small to ensure that the\n   garbage collector does not run more a handful of times per second.</li>\n<li><code>rt_cache_gc_goal_miss</code> is how often the garbage collector was not\n   able to fulfill its goal. This value should rarely be different of 0.</li>\n<li><code>rt_cache_gc_dst_overflow</code> is how often the route cache is bigger\n   than the allowed maximum size. This should never happen except\n   when you try to shrink the cache.</li>\n<li><code>rt_cache_in_hlist_search</code> and <code>rt_cache_out_hlist_search</code> is how\n   often a lookup in the cache had to look at the next entry in the\n   chain for the computed bucket: each time Linux has to follow the\n   <code>next</code> pointer in a cache entry, it increments one of those\n   counters. It is a clue on the average length of chains in the route\n   cache hash table. Compare those values with the number of cache\n   lookups (hit and miss).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As an illustration, here is a plot of the various statistics exposed\nabove for a router whose route cache receives about 1000 routes par second:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://d1g3mdmxf8zbo9.cloudfront.net/images/linux/routing-cache-stats.png\" alt=\"Plot of various statistics for the route cache\" title=\"Various statistics about the route cache\"></p>\n<p><code>rhash_entries</code> is 1,048,576, as is\n<code>net.ipv4.route.gc_thresh</code>. Therefore, the garbage collector was\nrequested to be run when the number of entries goes above this\nlevel. Because the cache is not full, it is only really run twice per\nseconds (the value of <code>net.ipv4.gc_interval_ms</code> is\n500). <code>net.ipv4.gc_elasticity</code> is set to 3. This explains why the\ngarbage collector is aggressive when the number of entries reached 3,145,728.</p>\n<p>As you can see, the efficiency is near 100% all the time. The\npercentage of collisions is <code>rt_cache_in_hlist_search</code> ratio to the\nsum of <code>rt_cache_in_hit</code> and <code>rt_cache_in_slow_tot</code>.</p>\n<h2>Tuning</h2>\n<p>Do you need to modify any of those values? You have two questions to\nask yourself:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>How much efficiency do you want to get from the route cache?</li>\n<li>How much memory do you want to dedicate to the route cache?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As a rule of thumb, two millions entries eat about 500 <span>MB</span> of memory on\na 64bit system. You should be able to compute the average memory usage\nand the maximum memory usage from the values of\n<code>net.ipv4.route.max_size</code>, <code>rhash_entries</code> and\n<code>net.ipv4.route.gc_elasticity</code>. For example, if the route cache hash\ntable has 262,144 buckets, the maximum allowed number of entries in\nthe cache is 4,194,304 and <code>net.ipv4.route.gc_elasticity</code> is set to 8,\nthe memory usage will be 500 <span>MB</span> on average and 1 <span>GB</span> max. If this is\ntoo much, you will need to lower some values.</p>\n<p>Look at the previous section to compute the current efficiency of your\nroute cache. It should be above 90%. If you are dissatisfied with\nthat, you could increase the cache size.</p>\n<p>If you want to double the number of entries, double\n<code>net.ipv4.route.max_size</code>, <code>net.ipv4.route.gc_thresh</code> and\n<code>rhash_entries</code> but keep <code>net.ipv4.route.gc_elasticity</code> to 8.</p>\n<p>For the garbage collector to be efficient, the route cache should not\nbe filled too fast. The garbage collector should be able to cope with\nthis situation but this may impact performance because it needs to\nwalk several times the route cache to find entries to expire. Watching\n<code>gc_goal_miss</code> may give you a hint about this: if this value starts to\nbe different of 0, lower <code>net.ipv4.gc_timeout</code>.</p>\n<h1>In-depth look into the garbage collector</h1>\n<p>Those different pieces of advice may have puzzled you. We need to\nunderstand how the garbage collector works to better cope with\nthem. The garbage collector is triggered when a new entry needs to be\nadded to the cache and the number of entries is superior to\n<code>net.ipv4.route.gc_thresh</code>. It is implemented in\n<a href=\"https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v3.1/net/ipv4/route.c#L880-L998\" title=\"rt_garbage_collect() in Linux 3.1\"><code>rt_garbage_collect()</code> function</a>. It will do\nnothing if it has been called less than\n<code>net.ipv4.route.gc_interval_ms</code> milliseconds and the cache is not full\n(more than <code>net.ipv4.route.max_size</code> entries).</p>\n<h2>Setting a goal</h2>\n<p>The garbage collector will first assess the situation. It will look how\nthe number of entries currently in the cache compares to the product\nof <code>rhash_entries</code> and <code>net.ipv4.gc_elasticity</code>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Above this limit, it will try to remove at least\n    <code>rhash_entries</code> entries.</li>\n<li>Otherwise, it will try to remove no more than half the difference.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you look at the previous plot, you can easily see the difference\nwhen the garbage collector is not aggressive (above 1,048,576 entries\nbut below 3,145,728) and when it is (above 3,145,728 entries). If we\nassume the garbage collector is able to meet its goal, we can easily\n<a href=\"https://gist.github.com/1460108\" title=\"Simulation of rt_garbage_collect()\">simulate its algorithm</a>:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://d1g3mdmxf8zbo9.cloudfront.net/images/linux/routing-cache-exp.png\" alt=\"Plot showing influence of various kernel parameters\" title=\"Variations of various cache parameters and their effects\"></p>\n<p>The first plot shows what would happen if about 2000 routes are added\nper second with <code>rhash_entries</code> equal to 262,144 and\n<code>net.ipv4.route.gc_elasticity</code> set to 8. When\n<code>net.ipv4.route.gc_threshold</code> is met, the garbage collector has almost\nno effect. However, when the number of entries reaches 2,097,152, the\ngarbage collector sets its goal to 262,144. From this point, the number\nof entries oscillates around 2 millions entries.</p>\n<p>On the second plot, <code>rhash_entries</code> is now equal to 1,048,576 but\n<code>net.ipv4.route.gc_elasticity</code> has been set to 2. Therefore, the\naggressive part of the garbage collectors kicks at the same threshold\nthan for the previous plot. However, its goal is now four times larger\nand the oscillations have a larger amplitude. The fact that the\naggressive part of the garbage collector kicks less often is nullified\nby the fact that it needs to remove more entries each time. Because of\nthe slight impact on cache efficiency, it seems better to keep\n<code>net.ipv4.route.gc_elasticity</code> around 8, or 4 if we want to keep\nshorter chains (but there seems to be no improvement to do so).</p>\n<p>The other plots show what happens when there is a sudden surge in the\nnumber of routes added or when there is a pause.</p>\n<h2>Meeting the goal</h2>\n<p>Now that we understand how <code>rhash_entries</code>,\n<code>net.ipv4.route.gc_elasticity</code> and <code>net.ipv4.route.gc_threshold</code>\ninteract, let’s look at <code>net.ipv4.route.gc_timeout</code>. Once the garbage\ncollector has set its goal and if it is positive, it needs to choose\nwhich entries to remove from the cache.</p>\n<p>It walks the hash table from the position of its last run and remove\nentries until its goal is met. If the entry is not current anymore\n(for example, the network interface associated to it has changed its\n<span>IP</span> configuration), it is removed. Otherwise, the system looks at the\nage of the entry and its position in the chain. If the entry is the\nfirst in the chain, it is kept only if its age is below\n<code>net.ipv4.route.gc_timeout</code>. If it is second, it is kept only if its\nage is below half of <code>net.ipv4.route.gc_timeout</code>. If it is third, the\nthreshold is a quarter of <code>net.ipv4.route.gc_timeout</code>, and so on. The\ngarbage collector will favor short chains.</p>\n<p>If after a full run of the hash table, the garbage collector was not\nable to meet its goal, it will start again but will behave more\naggressively, as if <code>net.ipv4.route.gc_timeout</code> is set to half of its\nvalue. It will do as many passes as necessary until its goal is met or\nuntil there is no way to remove any entry (or until it has spent too\nmuch time). Once the garbage collector has switched to this more\naggressive behavior, it will keep being aggressive for a few cycles\n(a bit less for each cycle).</p>\n<p>With a very large value of <code>net.ipv4.route.gc_timeout</code>, the garbage\ncollector will have a hard time to find entries to expire. It will\nneed to do several passes until it is able to expire some entries. On\nthe other hand, if you choose a very small value, the garbage\ncollector may remove entries that were just added, even if there are\nolder entries further in the hash table.</p>\n<p>For a more in-depth coverage of how the route cache works, look at\nchapter 33 of\n<em><a href=\"http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596002558.do\" title=\"Understanding Linux Network Internals\">Understanding Linux Network Internals</a></em>. Just be\naware that multipath route caching has been removed (and was never\nreally used) and asynchronous cleanup (<code>rt_periodic_timer</code>) does not\nexist anymore.</p>\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>When tuning the route cache, <code>rhash_entries</code>,\n<code>net.ipv4.route.gc_elasticity</code>, <code>net.ipv4.route.max_size</code> and\n<code>net.ipv4.route.gc_threshold</code> are related and should not be modified\nindependently. <code>net.ipv4.route.gc_thresh</code> should be below the product\nof <code>net.ipv4.route.gc_elasticity</code> and <code>rhash_entries</code> while\n<code>net.ipv4.route.max_size</code> should be above this value.</p>\n<p>Linux exposes several interesting metrics related to the route\ncache. Monitoring them allows one to watch the efficiency of the\nroute cache and may uncover some anomalies (garbage collector\nrunning too often, difficulty to remove routes from the cache, …).</p>\n<p>The route cache subsystem still evolves and some old behaviors have\nbeen dismissed. The best documentation is, unfortunately, still the\ncode and other documentations tend to become obsolete. The IPv6\nroute cache is quite different of the one presented here. Don’t\nblindly apply the same tuning for IPv6.</p>\n<div>\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Linux provides a protocol-independent destination cache\n    subsystem (<span>DST</span>). This component is not a generic cache layer\n    and only enables loose coupling with external subsystems. <a href=\"http://vincent.bernat.im/en/blog/atom.xml#fnref:dst\" title=\"Jump back to footnote 1 in the text\">↩</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Martian addresses are addresses that cannot be used as a\n        source address, either because they are reserved for\n        special-use (like a multicast address) or because of the\n        use of <em>reverse path filtering</em> which checks if a packet\n        received on one interface would be answered on the same\n        interface, as defined in <a href=\"http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3704\" title=\"RFC 3704: Ingress Filtering for Multihomed Networks\"><span>RFC</span> 3704</a>.

I bet that most all of you already know socket.io, however I had several people message me to do an article on socket.io, so here it is.</p>\n<p>Socket.io makes websockets and realtime possible in all browsers. It also enhances websockets by providing built-in multiplexing, horizontal scalability, and automatic JSON encoding/decoding. Socket.io is written by <a href=\"http://devthought.com/\">Guillermo Rauch</a>, who's the co-founder of <a href=\"https://www.learnboost.com/\">LearnBoost</a>.</p>\n<p>Socket.io always chooses the best realtime communication method possible. Here is the list of all the communication methods it supports:</p>\n<ul><li>WebSocket</li>\n<li>Adobe® Flash® Socket</li>\n<li>AJAX long polling</li>\n<li>AJAX multipart streaming</li>\n<li>Forever Iframe</li>\n<li>JSONP Polling</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For example, if you're using Chrome, then socket.io will use websockets. If your browser doesn't support websockets, it will try to use flash sockets, then it will try long polling, etc.</p>\n<p>Now let's look at a very basic socket.io example:</p>\n<div><pre><span>var</span> <span>io</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>&#39;socket.io&#39;</span><span>);</span>\n<span>var</span> <span>express</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>&#39;express&#39;</span><span>);</span>\n\n<span>var</span> <span>app</span> <span>=</span> <span>express</span><span>.</span><span>createServer</span><span>()</span>\n<span>var</span> <span>io</span> <span>=</span> <span>io</span><span>.</span><span>listen</span><span>(</span><span>app</span><span>);</span>\n\n<span>app</span><span>.</span><span>listen</span><span>(</span><span>80</span><span>);</span>\n\n<span>io</span><span>.</span><span>sockets</span><span>.</span><span>on</span><span>(</span><span>&#39;connection&#39;</span><span>,</span> <span>function</span> <span>(</span><span>socket</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>\n  <span>socket</span><span>.</span><span>emit</span><span>(</span><span>&#39;news&#39;</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span> <span>hello</span><span>:</span> <span>&#39;world&#39;</span> <span>});</span>\n  <span>socket</span><span>.</span><span>on</span><span>(</span><span>&#39;my other event&#39;</span><span>,</span> <span>function</span> <span>(</span><span>data</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>\n    <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>);</span>\n  <span>});</span>\n  <span>socket</span><span>.</span><span>on</span><span>(</span><span>&#39;disconnect&#39;</span><span>,</span> <span>function</span> <span>()</span> <span>{</span>\n    <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>&#39;user disconnected&#39;</span><span>);</span>\n  <span>});</span>\n<span>});</span>\n</pre>\n</div>\n<p>This example uses the awesome <a href=\"http://expressjs.com/\">express</a> node web framework (I'll blog about it soon) to setup a web server on port 80, and attaches socket.io to it.</p>\n<p>Socket.io then listens for new connections and when a new connection from the browser is created, it emits <code>news</code> event that sends the <code>{ hello: 'world' }</code> hash back to the browser.</p>\n<p>It also setups a listener for <code>my other event</code> and it listens for <code>disconnect</code>s. When the web application emits this event, socket.io calls the <code>function (data) { console.log(data); }</code> callback, that just prints the data to console. When the client disconnects, it logs this event to console also.</p>\n<p>Here is the client side (in the web browser):</p>\n<div><pre><span>&lt;script </span><span>src=</span><span>&quot;/socket.io/socket.io.js&quot;</span><span>&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>\n<span>&lt;script&gt;</span>\n  <span>var</span> <span>socket</span> <span>=</span> <span>io</span><span>.</span><span>connect</span><span>(</span><span>&#39;http://localhost&#39;</span><span>);</span>\n  <span>socket</span><span>.</span><span>on</span><span>(</span><span>&#39;news&#39;</span><span>,</span> <span>function</span> <span>(</span><span>data</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>\n    <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>);</span>\n    <span>socket</span><span>.</span><span>emit</span><span>(</span><span>&#39;my other event&#39;</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span> <span>my</span><span>:</span> <span>&#39;data&#39;</span> <span>});</span>\n  <span>});</span>\n<span>&lt;/script&gt;</span>\n</pre>\n</div>\n<p>First we include the <code>socket.io.js</code> script, and then we create a socket.io connection to <code>http://localhost</code>. Here socket.io chooses the best communication method that the browser supports. If it's Chrome then it will be websockets, then if you have flash, then it will try flash sockets, then long polling, then multipart streaming, then forever iframe method, and finally jsonp polling. Then we listen on <code>news</code> event and when we receive it, we emit <code>my other event</code>.</p>\n<p>This way you can build all kinds of awesome realtime applications, such as <a href=\"https://github.com/LearnBoost/socket.io/tree/master/examples/chat\">web chat servers</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/LearnBoost/socket.io/tree/master/examples/irc-output\">web irc clients</a>.</p>\n<p>There are many other features that socket.io supports, such as namespaces, volatile messages, message confirmations and message broadcasting. See <a href=\"https://github.com/LearnBoost/socket.io\">the documentation</a> to learn all about this awesomeness!</p>\n<p>You can install <code>socket.io</code> through npm as always:</p>\n<pre>\nnpm install socket.io\n</pre>\n<p>Socket.io on GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/LearnBoost/socket.io\">https://github.com/LearnBoost/socket.io</a>.</p>\n<p>Also take a look at <a href=\"http://www.catonmat.net/blog/nodejs-modules-dnode/\">dnode</a> that allows to call functions over socket.io!</p>\n<h2>Sponsor this blog series!</h2>\n<p>Doing a node.js company and want your ad to appear in the series?

      "content" : "A few times, when I've been working on something performance-critical, I've had people suggest (or ask me to review code) using QRegExp. I usually tell them that \"this is a bad idea, QRegExp is slow/unmaintained\", but I never actually sat down to do benchmarks. Well, in Qt 5, the subject of replacing QRegExp <a href=\"http://lists.qt-project.org/pipermail/development/2011-November/000423.html\">has been discussed a bit</a>, and we have a volunteer: <a href=\"mailto:dangelog@gmail.com\">Giuseppe D'Angelo</a>, a Qt hacker and italian student living in the UK (looking for work, by the way!).<br><br>One of the first steps he has taken has been to quantify the performance of two of our leading candidates for replacements: PCRE, and ICU's regex engine. He also took the liberty of benchmarking Qt's existing QRegExp - here's the results:<br><br>(Caveat: Giuseppe has asked for someone more familiar with ICU to <a href=\"http://qtl.me/cjL.txt\">look over the code</a> there to make sure the results aren&#39;t negatively impacted.)<br><br><br>RESULT : REBenchmark::PCREBenchmark():\"URI\":<br>     1,123 msecs per iteration (total: 1,123, iterations: 1)<br>RESULT : REBenchmark::PCREBenchmark():\"Email\":<br>     1,798 msecs per iteration (total: 1,798, iterations: 1)<br>RESULT : REBenchmark::PCREBenchmark():\"Date\":<br>     99 msecs per iteration (total: 99, iterations: 1)<br>RESULT : REBenchmark::PCREBenchmark():\"URI|Email\":<br>     2,650 msecs per iteration (total: 2,650, iterations: 1)<br><br>RESULT : REBenchmark::ICUBenchmark():\"URI\":<br>     11,674 msecs per iteration (total: 11,674, iterations: 1)<br>RESULT : REBenchmark::ICUBenchmark():\"Email\":<br>     17,056 msecs per iteration (total: 17,056, iterations: 1)<br>RESULT : REBenchmark::ICUBenchmark():\"Date\":<br>     392 msecs per iteration (total: 392, iterations: 1)<br>RESULT : REBenchmark::ICUBenchmark():\"URI|Email\":<br>     30,552 msecs per iteration (total: 30,552, iterations: 1)<br><br>RESULT : REBenchmark::QRegExpBenchmark():\"URI\":<br>     21,579 msecs per iteration (total: 21,579, iterations: 1)<br>RESULT : REBenchmark::QRegExpBenchmark():\"Email\":<br>     55,426 msecs per iteration (total: 55,426, iterations: 1)<br>RESULT : REBenchmark::QRegExpBenchmark():\"Date\":<br>     1,357 msecs per iteration (total: 1,357, iterations: 1)<br>RESULT : REBenchmark::QRegExpBenchmark():\"URI|Email\":<br>     77,224 msecs per iteration (total: 77,224, iterations: 1)<br><br>(These tests were run on: Ubuntu 10.04 LTS 32 bit, Core(TM)2 Duo CPU P9600  @ 2.66GHz, 4GB RAM, GCC 4.4.3, Qt 4.7.4, PCRE 8.20, ICU 4.8.1.1)<br><br>As we see from these results, PCRE is the clear winner, probably thanks to its use of JIT in evaluating the expressions. We see ICU showing decent results, and getting second place (see the caveat above). Leading the rear of the pack, we see QRegExp, 10x-30x slower than PCRE - and these are hardly complicated regular expressions.<br><br>In conclusion, for now, if you want performance, you should probably steer clear of QRegExp, and find other ways to do what you want, either using QString directly if it's a simple job, or looking into a light shim around another regex engine until Qt 5, when hopefully, your problems will go away with a shiny new class.<br><div><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5305500004159797797-3731253039337865131?l=blog.rburchell.com\" alt=\"\"></div>"

During this handshake, the server will present its\ncertificate and both the client and the server will agree on a <em>master\nsecret</em>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://d1g3mdmxf8zbo9.cloudfront.net/images/benchs-ssl/ssl-handshake.png\" alt=\"TLS full handshake\" title=\"Full TLS handshake\"></p>\n<p>This secret is built from a 48byte <em>premaster secret</em> generated and\nencrypted by the client with the public key of the server. It is then\nsent in a <em>Client Key Exchange</em> message to the server during the third\nstep of the <abbr title=\"Transport Layer Security\"><span>TLS</span></abbr> handshake. The <em>master secret</em> is derived from this\n<em>premaster secret</em> and random values sent in clear-text with <em>Client\nHello</em> and <em>Server Hello</em> messages.</p>\n<p>This scheme is secure as long as only the server is able to decrypt\nthe <em>premaster secret</em> (with its private key) sent by the\nclient. Let’s suppose that an attacker records all exchanges between\nthe server and clients during a year. Two years later, the server is\ndecommissioned and sent for recycling. The attacker is able to recover\nthe hard drive with the private key. She can now decrypt any session\nshe recorded: the encrypted premaster secret sent by a client is\ndecrypted with the private key and the master secret is derived from\nit. The attacker can now recover passwords and other sensitive\ninformation that can still be valuable today.</p>\n<p>The main problem lies in the fact that the private key is used for two\npurposes: <strong>authentication</strong> of the server and <strong>encryption</strong> of a\nshared secret. Authentication only matters while the communication is\nestablished, but encryption is expected to last for years.</p>\n<h1>Diffie-Hellman with discrete logarithm</h1>\n<p>One way to solve the problem is to keep using the private key for\nauthentication but uses an independent mechanism to agree on a shared\nsecret. Hopefully, there exists a well-known protocol for this: the\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie-Hellman\" title=\"Diffie-Hellman key exchange on Wikipedia\">Diffie-Hellman key exchange</a>. It is a method of exchanging keys\nwithout any prior knowledge. Here is how it works in <abbr title=\"Transport Layer Security\"><span>TLS</span></abbr>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The server needs to generate once (for example, with <code>openssl\n    dhparam</code> command):<ul>\n<li>·p·, a large <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number\" title=\"Prime numbers on Wikipedia\">prime number</a>,</li>\n<li>·g·, a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_root_modulo_n\" title=\"Primitive root modulo n on Wikipedia\">primitive root modulo ·p·</a> (for every integer\n   ·a· <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coprime\" title=\"Coprime numbers on Wikipedia\">coprime</a> to ·p·, there exists an integer ·k· such\n   that ·g^k=a\\mod p·).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The server picks a random integer ·a· and compute ·g^a \\mod\n    p·. After sending its regular <em>Certificate</em> message, it will also\n    send a <em>Server Key Exchange</em> message (not included in the\n    handshake depicted above) containing, unencrypted but signed with\n    its private key for authentication purpose:<ul>\n<li>random value from the <em>Client Hello</em> message,</li>\n<li>random value from the <em>Server Hello</em> message,</li>\n<li>·p·, ·g·,</li>\n<li>·g^a\\mod p=A·.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The client checks that the signature is correct. It also picks a\n    random integer ·b· and sends ·g^b \\mod p=B· in a <em>Client Key\n    Exchange</em> message. It will also compute ·A^b\\mod p=g^{ab}\\mod p·\n    which is the <em>premaster secret</em> from which the <em>master secret</em> is derived.</li>\n<li>The server will receive ·B· and compute ·B^a\\mod p=g^{ab}\\mod p·\n    which is the same <em>premaster secret</em> known by the client.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Again, the private key is only used for authentication purpose. An\neavesdropper will only know ·p·, ·g·, ·g^a\\mod p· and ·g^b\\mod\np·. Computing ·g^{ab}\\mod p· from those values is the\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_logarithm\" title=\"Discrete Logarithm on Wikipedia\">discrete logarithm</a> problem for which there is no known\nefficient solution.</p>\n<p>Because the Diffie-Hellman exchange described above always uses new\nrandom values ·a· and ·b·, it is called <em>Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman</em>\n(<span>EDH</span> or <span>DHE</span>). Cipher suites like <code>DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA</code> use this\nprotocol to achieve <em>perfect forward secrecy</em><sup><a href=\"http://vincent.bernat.im/en/blog/atom.xml#fn:pfs\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>To achieve a good level of security, parameters of the same size as\nthe key are usually used (the security provided by the discrete\nlogarithm problem is about the same as the security provided by\nfactorisation of two large prime numbers) and therefore, the\nexponentiation operations are pretty slow as we can see in the\nbenchmark below:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://d1g3mdmxf8zbo9.cloudfront.net/images/benchs-ssl/dhe-impact.png\" alt=\"Graphical comparison of speed with and without DHE\" title=\"Performances of stud on 6 cores, with and without DHE with a 1024bit key\"></p>\n<h1>Diffie-Hellman with elliptic curves</h1>\n<p>Fortunately, there exists another way to achieve a Diffie-Hellman key\nexchange with the help of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve_cryptography\" title=\"Elliptic curve cryptography on Wikipedia\">elliptic curve cryptography</a> which is\nbased on the algebraic structure of elliptic curves over finite\nfields. To get some background on this, be sure to check first\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve\" title=\"Elliptic curves on Wikipedia\">Wikipedia article on elliptic curves</a>. Elliptic curve\ncryptography allows one to achieve the same level of security than <span>RSA</span>\nwith smaller keys. For example, a 224bit elliptic curve is believed to\nbe <a href=\"http://www.keylength.com/en/compare/\" title=\"Cryptographic key length recommendation\">as secure as a 2048bit <span>RSA</span> key</a>.</p>\n<h2>Some theory</h2>\n<p>Diffie-Hellman key exchange described above can easily be translated\nto elliptic curves. Instead of defining ·p· and ·g·, you get some\nelliptic curve, ·y^2=x^3+\\alpha x+\\beta·, a prime ·p· and a base\npoint ·G·. All those parameters are public. In fact, while they can be\ngenerated by the server, this is a difficult operation and they are\nusually chosen among a set of published ones.</p>\n<p>The use of elliptic curves is an extension of <abbr title=\"Transport Layer Security\"><span>TLS</span></abbr> described in\n<a href=\"http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4492\" title=\"RFC 4492: ECC Cipher Suites for TLS\"><span>RFC</span> 4492</a>. Unlike with the classic Diffie-Hellman key\nexchange, the client and the server need to agree on the various\nparemeters. Most of this agreement is done inside <em>Client Hello</em> and\n<em>Server Hello</em> messages. While it is possible to define some arbitrary\nparameters, web browsers will only support a handful of predefined\ncurves, usually <span>NIST</span> P-256, P-384 and P-521. From here, the key\nexchange with elliptic curves is pretty similar to the classic\nDiffie-Hellman one:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The server picks a random integer ·a· and compute ·aG· which will\n    be sent, unencrypted but signed with its private key for\n    authentication purpose, in a <em>Server Key Exchange</em> message.</li>\n<li>The client checks that the signature is correct. It also picks a\n    random integer ·b· and sends ·bG· in a <em>Client Key Exchange</em>\n    message. It will also compute ·b\\cdot aG=abG· which is the\n    <em>premaster secret</em> from which the <em>master secret</em> is derived.</li>\n<li>The server will receive ·bG· and compute ·a\\cdot bG=abG·\n    which is the same <em>premaster secret</em> known by the client.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>An eavesdropper will only see ·aG· and ·bG· and won’t be able to\ncompute efficiently ·abG·.</p>\n<p>Using <code>ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA</code> cipher suite (with P-256 for example) is\nalready a huge speed improvement over <code>DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA</code> thanks to\nthe reduced size of the various parameters involved.</p>\n<p>Web browsers only support a handful of well-defined elliptic curves,\nchosen to ease an efficient implementation. Bodo Möller, Emilia Käsper\nand Adam Langley have provided 64bit optimized versions of <span>NIST</span> P-224,\nP-256 and P-521 for OpenSSL. To get even more details on the matter,\nyou can read the end of the\n<a href=\"http://www.imperialviolet.org/2010/12/04/ecc.html\" title=\"Elliptic curves and their implementation\">introduction on elliptic curves</a> from Adam Langley, then a\n<a href=\"http://research.google.com/pubs/archive/37376.pdf\" title=\"Fast Elliptic Curve Cryptography in OpenSSL\">short paper from Emilia Käsper</a> which presents a 64bit\noptimized implementation of the <span>NIST</span> elliptic curve <span>NIST</span> P-224.</p>\n<h2>In practice</h2>\n<p>First, keep in mind that elliptic curve cryptography is not supported\nby all browsers. Recent versions of Firefox and Chrome should handle\n<span>NIST</span> P-256, P-384 and P-521 but for most versions Internet Explorer,\nyou are currently out of luck. Therefore, you need to keep accepting\nother cipher suites.</p>\n<p>You need a recent version of OpenSSL. Support for <span>ECDHE</span> cipher suites\nhas been added in <strong>OpenSSL 1.0.0</strong>. Check with <code>openssl ciphers ECDH</code>\nthat your version supports them. If you want to use the 64bit\noptimized version, you need to run a snapshot of OpenSSL 1.0.1,\nconfigured with <code>enable-ec_nistp_64_gcc_128</code> option. A recent <span>GCC</span> is\nalso required in this case.</p>\n<p>Next, you need to choose the appropriate <strong>cipher suites</strong>. If\nforward secrecy is an option for you, you can opt for\n<code>ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:AES128-SHA:RC4-SHA</code> cipher suites which should be\ncompatible with most browsers. If you really need forward secrecy, you\nmay opt for\n<code>ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:EDH-DSS-DES-CBC3-SHA</code>\ninstead.</p>\n<p>Then, you need to ensure the <strong>order of cipher suites is\nrespected</strong>. On <em>nginx</em>, this is done with <code>ssl_prefer_server_ciphers\non</code>. On <em>Apache</em>, this is <code>SSLHonorCipherOrder on</code>.</p>\n<p><strong><span>UPDATED</span>:</strong> You need to check <strong><span>ECDHE</span> support for your web\nserver</strong>. For <em>nginx</em>, the support has been added in 1.0.6 and\n1.1.0. The curve selected defaults to <span>NIST</span> P-256. You can specify\nanother one with <code>ssl_ecdh_curve</code> directive. For <em>Apache</em>, it has been\nadded in 2.3.3 and does not exist in the current stable branch. Adding\nsupport for <span>ECDHE</span> is quite easy. You can check\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bumptech/stud/pull/61\" title=\"Adding support for ECDHE in stud\">how I added it in <em>stud</em></a>. This issue also exists for <span>DHE</span>\ncipher suites, in which case you also might have to specify <span>DH</span>\nparameters to use (generated with <code>openssl dhparam</code>) using some\nspecial directive or by appending the parameters to the\ncertificate. Check <a href=\"https://tech.immerda.ch/?p=84\" title=\"The state of Forward Secrecy in OpenSSL\">Immerda Techblog article</a> for more\nbackground about this point.</p>\n<p>The implementation of <a href=\"http://vincent.bernat.im/en/blog/2011-ssl-session-reuse-rfc5077.html\" title=\"Speeding up SSL: enabling session reuse\"><abbr title=\"Transport Layer Security\"><abbr title=\"Transport Layer Security\"><span>TLS</span></abbr></abbr> session tickets</a> may be\nincompatible with forward secrecy, depending on how they are\nimplemented. When they are protected by a random key generated at the\nstart of the server, the same key could be used for months. Some\nimplementations<sup><a href=\"http://vincent.bernat.im/en/blog/atom.xml#fn:stud\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a></sup> may derive the key from the private key. In\nthis case, forward secrecy is broken. If forward secrecy is a\nrequirement for you, you need to either disable tickets or ensure that\nkey rotation happens often.</p>\n<p>Check with <code>openssl s_client -tls1 -cipher ECDH -connect\n127.0.0.1:443</code> that everything works as expected.</p>\n<h2>Some benchmarks</h2>\n<p>With the help of the <a href=\"https://github.com/vincentbernat/ssl-dos/blob/master/server-vs-client.c\" title=\"Tool compare processing power needed by client and server\">micro-benchmark tool</a> that I\ndeveloped for my <a href=\"http://vincent.bernat.im/en/blog/2011-ssl-dos-mitigation.html\" title=\"SSL computational DoS mitigation\">previous article</a>, we can compare the\nefficiency of cipher suites providing forward secrecy:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://d1g3mdmxf8zbo9.cloudfront.net/images/benchs-ssl/ecdhe.png\" alt=\"Speed comparison with/without DHE/ECDHE\" title=\"Compared performance for 1000 handshakes of various cipher suites (RSA 2048, DHE, ECDHE, optimized ECDHE)\"></p>\n<p>I have used a <a href=\"ftp://ftp.openssl.org/snapshot/openssl-1.0.1-stable-SNAP-20111125.tar.gz\">snapshot of OpenSSL 1.0.1 (2011/11/25)</a>. The\noptimized version of <span>ECDHE</span> is the one you get by using\n<code>enable-ec_nistp_64_gcc_128</code> option when configuring OpenSSL.</p>\n<p>Let’s focus on the server part. Enabling <code>DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA</code> cipher\nsuite hinders the performance of <abbr title=\"Transport Layer Security\"><span>TLS</span></abbr> handshakes by a factor of\n3. Using <code>ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA</code> instead only adds an overhead of\n27%. However, if we use the 64bit optimized version, the <strong>cost is\nonly 15%</strong>. The overhead is only per full <abbr title=\"Transport Layer Security\"><span>TLS</span></abbr> handshake. If 3 out of 4\nof your handshakes are resumed, you need to adjust the numbers.</p>\n<p>Your mileage may vary but the computational cost for enabling perfect\nforward secrecy with an <span>ECDHE</span> cipher suite seems a small sacrifice for\nbetter security.</p>\n<div>\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><em>Perfect forward secrecy</em> is an enhanced version of <em>forward\n    secrecy</em>.

Users can install and run AIR 2.6 and earlier applications but can't install or update to AIR 2.7. The last version to support desktop Linux distributions is AIR 2.6. </blockquote> So on the exact same day, Adobe said \"we recommend you upgrade, as the version you are using is vulnerable\" and \"we offer you no way to upgrade\". <p> I'm left with the conclusion that Adobe's aggregate corporate message is \"users of desktops based on free software should immediately uninstall AIR and stop using it\". </p><p> If Adobe's software was free, and they had a community around it, they could turn over support to the community if they found it too burdensome. Instead, once again, users of proprietary tools on free systems get screwed by the proprietary vendor. </p><p> And they wonder why we tend to be less likely to install their tools? </p><p> Application developers should avoid targeting AIR as a platform if they want to reach everyone.</p><p><b>Tags</b>: <a href=\"https://www.debian-administration.org/tag/adobe\">adobe</a>, <a href=\"https://www.debian-administration.org/tag/proprietary%20software\">proprietary software</a>, <a href=\"https://www.debian-administration.org/tag/security\">security</a></p>"

      "content" : "<img src=\"http://planet.debian.org/heads/ncommander.png\" width=\"65\" height=\"82\" alt=\"\" align=\"right\" style=\"float:right\">  There's been a lot of noise with Microsoft requiring Secure Boot for Windows 8 OEMs. For those of you unfamiliar with it, Secure Boot requires that the boot chain is signed, and this 'feature' must be enabled by default. Although I have been unable to find specific details, it appears that the chain of trust needs to extend from BIOS/UEFI all the way down to the kernel. Obviously, requiring a signed boot chain makes using FOSS platforms like Ubuntu or Debian an impossibility short of having the UEFI Platform Key and resigning the entire chain.<br><br>Steven Sinofsky's MSDN <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/b8/archive/2011/09/22/protecting-the-pre-os-environment-with-uefi.aspx\">blog</a> has a fairly good overview how it works. Canonical and Red Hat also have a good <a href=\"http://blog.canonical.com/2011/10/28/white-paper-secure-boot-impact-on-linux/\">white paper</a> on why secure boot is a serious problem for Linux distributions. Even if secure boot itself can be disabled, it *greatly* rises the bar for general end-users to successfully install Ubuntu on their machine. In addition, it is the responsibility of OEM and BIOS manufacturers to provide the option to disable it. <br><br>There already has been a long history of OEMs removing BIOS options or introducing DRM; for instance, <a href=\"http://tjworld.net/wiki/Sony/Vaio/FE41Z/HackingBiosNvram\">locking out VTx on Sony laptops</a>, or <a href=\"http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Problem_with_unauthorized_MiniPCI_network_card\">restricting laptops to only accept 'branded' wifi and 3G cards</a>. Given this track record, can OEMs realistically be trusted to have this option available?<br><br>What most people don't realize is that secure boot itself is not a new concept; its simply part of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_Computing\">Trusted Computing</a> initiative, and has been implemented on embedded platforms for many years. If you own any iPhone, or one of the vast majority of Android devices, you are using a device that either has the secure boot feature, or something very close. This especially painful in Android as Google's security system restricts users to a *very* limited shell and subset of utilities which can be used on non-rooted devices. WebOS, Maemo, and to my knowledge Meego give the end-user full unrestricted access to the boot chain and you can swap kernels and even the entire OS out if one was so motivated.<br><br>Although it is still an ongoing problem, several vendors such as <a href=\"http://htcdev.com/bootloader\">HTC</a>, <a href=\"http://www.androidpolice.com/2011/04/15/rumor-samsung-to-unlock-bootloaders-on-future-devices/\">Samsung</a>, <a href=\"http://www.talkandroid.com/68550-droid-razr-will-have-unlockable-bootloader-for-international-version-only/\">Motorola (kinda)</a>, and even <a href=\"http://www.androidpolice.com/2011/03/29/sony-ericsson-promises-unlocked-bootloaders-in-some-flavors-of-all-upcoming-xperia-devices-arc-play-neo-pro/\">Sony</a>. In the Android community, having unlockable bootloaders has been a welcome middle ground in the traditionally restrictive and locked-down world of cellular devices.<br><br>While some may argue that such locks are necessary to protect consumers, it is perfectly feasible to create devices with unlocked bootloaders that are still secure. The Nook Color's is  an Android powered eReader. It's stock firmware doesn't allow sideloaded applications or even access to a user shell via adb, but the BootROM on the device attempts to boot from the microSD card before eMMC, making it possible for enterprising users to easily modify the underlying OS (as well as making it physically impossible to brick the device due to a bad flash). Barnes and Nobles even sells a book on rooting the Nook Color; it was right next to the devices on display at the time. In addition, they've continued the tradition of easily modifiable devices with both the Nook Simple Touch, and the Nook Tablet.<br><br>One of the most impressive attributes is the possibility of running Ubuntu on it. The absolute poster child for this is the <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2010/06/21/toshibas-ac100-8-hour-smartbook-runs-android-2-1-on-a-1ghz-tegr/\">Toshiba AC100</a>. For those of you unfamiliar, it ultralight netbook that shipped with Android 2.1/2.2 with easy access to the built in flash via the mini-USB port on the side of the device. Due to the valiant efforts of the AC100 community, Ubuntu was ported to this device, and became a supported platform with <a href=\"http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/oneiric/release/\"> images available on cdimages.ubuntu.com</a>. If you were an attendee at UDS, you likely saw several AC100s all running Ubuntu.<br><br>This brings me to the point that motivated me to write this post in the first place. One of the most impressive tablets I've seen to date is the <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2011/04/18/asus-eee-pad-transformer-uk-edition-review/\">ASUS eeePad Transformer</a>, an Android tablet with fully dockable keyboard. I have one of these devices, and its one of the most impressive and usable Android tablets I own. Sadly, such a powerful device was hobbled from its true potential due to ASUS's decision to ship the device with a locked and encrypted bootloader. Surprisingly, the Secure Boot Key (SBK) was acquired and released to the wild, making it possible to reflash the device. Sadly, even with the SBK, <a href=\"http://androidroot.mobi/technical/tf-secure-boot-key/\">the device's bootloader</a> is still extremely hobbled compared to the AC100 making flashing a slow and difficult process.<br><br>In response, ASUS refreshed the eeePad's hardware to the new B70 SKU, which has a new Secure Boot. Despite this, <a href=\"http://androidroot.mobi/2011/11/14/introducing-razorclaw-v1/\">a root exploit was recently found</a> to allow people to circumvent these restrictions and install customs ROMs. It is however only a manor of time before ASUS responds and releases a new update that fixes this bug.<br><br>Steven Barker (lilstevie) on <a href=\"http://www.xda-developers.com/\">xda-developers</a> successfully created a <a href=\"http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1280774\">port of Ubuntu</a> to the Transformer. Currently, installing Ubuntu on the Transformer requires nvflash access, so its not possible to use his image on the newly liberated B70 devices. I am certain that a new method of installing via an update.zip will be developed for those of us with hobbled devices.<br><br>It is a showcase of what is possible when you have open hardware, and also proves one indisputable point: any 'trusted boot' or DRM scheme can and will be defeated; at best you piss off your userbase, and at worst, you force users to exploit bugs to gain control of their device. As it is impossible to reflash these devices from the bootloader, a failed kernel flash WILL brick these devices, increasing warranty and support costs as users try to return their now broken devices.<br><br>In closing, while there have been some victories in ongoing war of open hardware vs. trusted comptuing, the road ahead still remains very murky. Victories in the mobile market have shown that there is a market for open devices. Google's own Nexus One was sold as a developers phone and as a way to encourage manufacturers to raise the bar. <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2010/04/15/feel-goodroid-nexus-one-is-in-the-black-60k-android-devices-ac/\">It sold well enough to recoup its development costs.</a>. While there is no official statements, <a href=\"http://talk.maemo.org/showthread.php?s=6404fbde3c35d28e0d32b619b6d7c279&amp;t=41798\">the Nokia N900 is suspected to have broken all sales expectations</a>, backed up by the fact that <a href=\"http://www.pocketgamer.biz/r/PG.Biz/Rovio+news/news.asp?c=17921\">Angry Birds sold extremely well on the Ovi Store for the N900</a>.<br><br>From the article in question:<br><blockquote>What reaction have you had in terms of sales and customer feedback?<br><br>Angry Birds had already been launched on App Store before it came out on Ovi Store, and it had a great review average from iPhone reviewers and users alike, so we expected a good reception from N900 users as well.<br><br>Even so, we were quite surprised by just how the N900 community immediately took the game to heart. The game obviously made many people very happy, and that is really the greatest achievement that anyone who creates entertainment for a living can hope for. Well, maybe the greatest achievement is huge bundles of cash, but making people happy comes a close second.<br><br>In the first week that Angry Birds has been on the Ovi Store, it has been downloaded almost as many times as the iPhone version in six weeks. Given that most N900 users have not even used Ovi Store yet, we are confident that there will be many more downloads in the months to come, and are sure that the N900 version will be very profitable.</blockquote><br>That being said, with Microsoft pushing secure boot and trusted computing down everyone's throats with Windows 8, it is hard to say what the future might hold for those of us who want to own our devices.<div><img src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4695702196537398257-762080050329986563?l=ncommander.blogspot.com\" alt=\"\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"></div>"

This is described as leading to an improvement in the web experience for iPhone and iPad users, but the more important thing is that it will improve the experience for everyone. The Flash plugin has always been a resource hog and has never been properly supported on all the common platforms. Also most sites that use Flash never needed to as there were other ways of getting equal or better results without it.</p>\n<p>Now that Flash is officially on the path to obsolescence everyone can move to HTML5.</p>\n<p>I use the following configuration directives in my Squid configuration to block Flash, I selectively enable Flash for the few web sites which use it for useful things. Blocking flash in this manner means that desktop systems which have the Flash plugin installed probably won’t be vulnerable to Flash security flaws as it is unlikely that one of the few sites that I permit to send Flash to my network would end up hosting hostile Flash code.</p>\n<p><b>acl swf url_regex swf$ swf\\?<br>\nacl swftype req_mime_type -i ^application/x-shockwave-flash$<br>\nhttp_access deny swf<br>\nhttp_access deny swftype</b></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_HTML5_and_Flash\">Wikipedia has a comparison of HTML5 and Flash</a>. One interesting benefit that is claimed for Flash is that it allows DRM and it supports inserting commercials and in other ways giving the user an experience that they don’t want. It seems that to put some more nails in the Flash coffin we need tools to suck video from Flash sites regardless of DRM and which skip commercials.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>[1]<a href=\"http://www.theage.com.au/technology/technology-news/adobe-surrenders-to-apple-in-mobile-flash-war-20111110-1n85p.html\"> http://www.theage.com.au/technology/technology-news/adobe-surrenders-to-apple-in-mobile-flash-war-20111110-1n85p.html</a></li>\n</ul>"

      "content" : "<p>The other day, I was asked if it was really possible to get build-arch support in Wheezy (as in, buildds using build-arch) by adding these optional targets.</p>\n<p>Lets have a look at the data that is available to us:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>At least ~500 packages must be fixed (the “<a href=\"http://people.debian.org/~nthykier/rg-build-arch-target/dd-list-reduced\">reduced set</a>“)</li>\n<li>The Wheezy freeze is expected in June (as I recall, I may be off)</li>\n<ul>\n<li>NMUs can take quite a while, so lets reduce it to May.</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<p>To simplify my calculation I will assume we can fix packages over a course of 150 days (which is 5 months of ~30 days or every day in Dec to April). So 500/150 = 10/3 =~ 3.3 packages from the reduced set should be fixed every day.  Erring on the side of caution, we should make that 4 packages every day.</p>\n<p>So if we fix 4 packages from the reduced set every day, we will <em>definitely</em> fix all of them before Wheezy.<em></em>  But the reduced set are only the source packages that could possibly “benefit” from having a build-arch target (it builds both arch:all and non-arch:all packages).   There could (and probably will) still be sources building non-arch:all packages without a build-arch target.  Furthermore, with the rate of 4 a day we will only have a month to get dpkg and buildd support…</p>\n<p>In short, no.  I do not expect us to get archive-wide build-arch support on buildds for Wheezy.  But I will do my best to ensure that <a href=\"http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=629385#93\">option #4 “flip the switch”</a> becomes very attractive early in the “Wheezy + 1″ development schedule.</p>\n<p>I hope you will join us in this endeavour.  Most of the time it is a trivial 3-4 line fix and often you can even throw in some <a href=\"https://wiki.debian.org/ReleaseGoals/SecurityHardeningBuildFlags\">hardening flags</a> to spice it up a bit.  The easiest way to help is to fix your (team’s) packages listed in the “<a href=\"http://people.debian.org/%7Enthykier/rg-build-arch-target/dd-list-reduced\">reduced set</a>“.   Once you are done with that you can look at the “rest” of your (team’s) packages (see the full <a href=\"http://people.debian.org/~nthykier/rg-build-arch-target/dd-list\">dd-list</a>).</p>\n<p>The most important thing to remember is that <em>Build-Depends-Indep is still broken!</em>  That is, <em>you cannot rely on Build-Depends-Indep being installed on a buildd in the “build” target</em>.<em></em>  So any existing workarounds have to stay for now (i.e. check for certain commands or deferring indep till binary-indep is called).  If you are in doubt about how to fix a certain package feel free to ask for help.</p>\n<p>Note: I pull the data directly from lintian.d.o (full set) and UDD (reduced set).  I try to remember to refresh it daily.  The full set is basically (z)grep | cut | uniq on the lintian log, the reduced set is found using the UDD query from <a href=\"http://people.debian.org/~nthykier/rg-build-arch-target/reduced-set.py\">this script</a> (based on a query done by Jakub Wilk).  Since all data is (in)directly based on lintian.d.o only packages that are in sid are considered.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<br>  <a href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/nthykier.wordpress.com/91/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/nthykier.wordpress.com/91/\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/nthykier.wordpress.com/91/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/delicious/nthykier.wordpress.com/91/\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gofacebook/nthykier.wordpress.com/91/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/facebook/nthykier.wordpress.com/91/\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gotwitter/nthykier.wordpress.com/91/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/twitter/nthykier.wordpress.com/91/\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/nthykier.wordpress.com/91/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/stumble/nthykier.wordpress.com/91/\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/nthykier.wordpress.com/91/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/digg/nthykier.wordpress.com/91/\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/nthykier.wordpress.com/91/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/reddit/nthykier.wordpress.com/91/\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></a> <img src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=nthykier.wordpress.com&amp;blog=21789318&amp;post=91&amp;subd=nthykier&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1\" alt=\"\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" width=\"1\">"

      "content" : "<img src=\"http://planet.debian.org/heads/adnan.png\" width=\"83\" height=\"85\" alt=\"\" align=\"right\" style=\"float:right\">  <p>This blog post isn’t only directed to ThinkPad owners as most notebook Linux users with Intel Core Duo 1/2 and i3/i5/i7 processors have been affected by this bug if not all. And yes, this problem is present on latest Debian Unstable and Ubuntu 11.10.</p>\n<p><strong>Prelude</strong></p>\n<p>I’m owner of <a href=\"http://foolcontrol.org/?p=180\" title=\"Lenovo X300 review - Debian Lenny\">Thinkpad X300</a>, great machine except the fact that just recently I replaced its <strong>3rd</strong> cooling fan!  Yea, I do a lot of compiling and it’s on all the time, but still this kind of things shouldn’t happen. I first linked this problem to the fact that Thinkpad fan on Linux (as of 2.6.22) <em>always works</em> at what’s its basically maximum RPM, thus the reason there are <a href=\"http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Fan_control_scripts\" title=\"Fan control scripts\">numerous fan control scripts</a>. My favorite one is Thinkfan, but <a href=\"http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/How_to_control_fan_speed\">controlling fan</a> doesn’t really help if you have a overheating problem. For matter of a fact it working on its maximum speed might only help, with its own toll.</p>\n<p>As of kernel 2.6.38 up until 3.1 (still present) there has been a <a href=\"http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&amp;item=linux_mobile_uffda\" title=\"[Phronix] Mobile Users Beware: Linux Has Major Power Regression\">problem of power regression</a> but besides this I had slight problem with overheating. Regarding overheating in beginning I tried <a href=\"http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=583315\" title=\"ThinkPad X300 overheating on suspend  \">reporting bugs</a>, tried different Thinkfan configurations, blamed proprietary software such as Adobe Flash for spiking up CPU temperature, however this problem was somewhat solved. After numerous battery calibrations and as these didn’t work in the end for battery life getting poorer with each day, I just blamed the factor that notebook  was getting pretty old (~3 years).</p>\n<p>Then the consumer woke up inside of me and I thought it was time to get new notebook. I laid my eyes upon <a href=\"http://www.lenovo.com/products/us/laptop/thinkpad/x-series/x1/\">ThinkPad X1</a> thing of beauty except one mayor drawback, its price. I did some reading on X1 and interesting enough, X300 comes with Core Duo 2 L7100 but overheating + power regression was still present even on latest Intel Core I* series. Reading this killed the consumer and woke up the hacker side.</p>\n<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>\n<p>Initial workaround to the problems of power regression is to add “<a href=\"http://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Power_Management_Guide/ASPM.html\" title=\"Active-State Power Management (ASPM) \">pcie_aspm=force</a>” besides existing GRUB boot arguments, this did help to some point but what really helped in both cases was also adding “i915.i915_enable_rc6=1″ or at least I thought so since this line only applies to Sandy Bridge (i3/i5/i7) and latter. In the end my “/etc/default/grub” looks like:</p>\n<pre>GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash pcie_aspm=force i915.i915_enable_rc6=1\"</pre>\n<p>and make sure you run “update-grub” after making these changes. Besides the arguments I used there are other ones you can use and for more info please head to ”<a href=\"http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&amp;item=intel_i915_power\" title=\"Tweaks To Extend The Battery Life Of Intel Linux Notebooks\">Tweaks To Extend The Battery Life Of Intel Linux Notebooks</a>“.</p>\n<p>Results I ended up with such simple tweak are more then satisfactory as I got some ~45 extra minutes of battery life besides the fact that it lowered temperature by some ~10 °C. Guess this also gives me extra time until I get a chance to lay my hands on X1 <img src=\"http://foolcontrol.org/wp-content/plugins/tango-smileys-extended/tango/smile.png\" title=\"Smile\" height=\"16\" width=\"16\" alt=\"Smile\"></p>\n<p><strong>P.S:</strong></p>\n<p>After I posted this some argued that this is a workaround rather then a fix and folks at [Phoronix] <em>just</em> posted what they call a <a href=\"http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&amp;item=linux_aspm_solution\">proper solution</a> to this problem.  Also please note although Sandy Bridge users that enable this might sometimes get a <a href=\"https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=41682\">video corruption bug</a>, i915_enable_rc6 is still supposed to get enabled by default in 3.2. So logical conclusion you can come up with is unless you’re troubled by this problem, you might not want to use this “work around/fix” at this point. And hope it’ll be fixed in future releases of your favorite Linux distribution.</p>"

So here goes a brain-dump, hope some people find it useful <img src=\"http://labs.qt.nokia.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\"> </p>\n<p>If you want to know more about the basics of accelerated compositing, please read <a href=\"http://ariya.blogspot.com/2011/07/fluid-animation-with-accelerated.html\">Ariya’s blog</a> first (or <a href=\"http://www.sencha.com/blog/understanding-hardware-acceleration-on-mobile-browsers/\">this one</a>, also from Ariya), as this post is maybe a bit more advanced. Please proceed if you’re interested in QtWebKit internals regarding accelerated graphics…</p>\n<p><span></span>First of all, <a title=\"Blog about TextureMapper\" href=\"http://qtwebkit.blogspot.com/2010/10/texture-mapper-accelerated-compositing.html\">TextureMapper</a> has now been enabled by default in trunk for a while; This means that QtWebKit now has its own mini-scenegraph, which is optimized for CSS animations and transforms and for nothing else.<br>\nSince TextureMapper has no public API, it’s easy to modify it and to optimize it further for any strange CSS ideas that come in the future, such as <a href=\"https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/FXTF/raw-file/tip/custom/index.html\">the new CSS shader proposal</a>, and to incorporate all the odd CSS 3D-transform rules like preserves-3d.</p>\n<p>Second, a lot of work was done to make the standard web content work well with the tiled backing store. On WebKit2, the WebKit multi-process model, this becomes ever more important, as the CPU-based rendering is done in a background process, and then passed to the UI process as shared memory that gets uploaded to textures. The UI process can remain responsive even if the web process takes a long time rendering text, paths or other non-trivial tasks. With a good cross-process tiled backing store, we apply interesting user-experience optimizations for touch manipulation, such as rendering tiles that are likely to appear on the screen soon, based on the user’s scrolling trajectory.</p>\n<p><strong>Speaking of WebKit2…</strong></p>\n<p>Getting accelerated compositing working in a cross process environment was an interesting challenge. Different ports have solved it in different ways; For Apple, accelerated compositing works on top of CoreAnimation which is a cross-process architecture to begin with. Chromium uses an additional “GPU process” which is not feasible for the mobile platforms which we were trying to support. The main question that we had to solve, was where to perform the actual composition. WebKit gives us a layer tree, image updates to each layer, and animations and rendering info for each layer. All of that happens on the web process. In our browsers and in the QML web-views, we use the GPU extensively in the UI process as well, for example for zooming with a two-finger gesture. How do we integrate GPU operations driven by web page in the web process, with GPU operations driven by the user in the UI process?</p>\n<p>There were two options:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Perform the composition of layers in the web process with OpenGL, and composite the result with the application’s scene in the client, using cross-process image sharing such as X11 or EGL.</li>\n<li>Pass all the layer tree information and image information to the UI process, and do the actual OpenGL compositing in the UI process.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We originally started with option (1) as it was straightforward. The problem was that on mobile platforms that resulted in repetitive context-switching, difficulties in syncing, and in general a low frame rate which we couldn’t overcome. So we moved to option (2). This took a lot of boring broiler-plate code to serialize the layer tree and animation information to the UI process, but in the end it paid off. We get a bit of an overhead to get the layer tree set up and the animation started, but when it is, the actual compositing of frames is done entirely in the UI process, and is composited in one place using OpenGL together with the user-driven compositing like zoom/scroll gestures.</p>\n<p>When we had that in place for WebKit2, there were a few problems that arose due to the fact that the accelerated compositing path and the tiled backing-store path were different. We had used the tiled backing store path only for the “non-composited” content on the screen, and painted the composited layers on top. While this had let us optimize heavily for the non-composited content, which is the bulk of content on the internet, it created some annoying bugs. Those bugs came about for sites that had big chunks of content, with some effects like animated rotations that usually get composited. We had a lot of intelligence, such as applying contents-scale to the rendered content to make it look crisp if you zoom in or out, that was part of the tiled backing-store code path, so it never got called for the accelerated compositing code-path. This meant that some content was crisp and other content was blurry, based on whether or not it happened to be painted with the accelerated-compositing code path. That is, of course, iffy… not to mention tearing when we had animations driven both in the web-process and in the UI process (for example a “left” transition on one element and a “-webkit-transform” transition on another element).</p>\n<p>In the version currently being worked on for trunk, we took one step further towards fixing this. Instead of having the composited layers “on top” of the non-composited layers, we run everything through the accelerated compositing code path, having the non-composited content as one of the layers, just at a lower z-index. This allows us to synchronize all the layers and their tiles together, and to apply the crisp content scaling to all the layers, whether they’re the bottom one or not.</p>\n<p><strong>Why not use the QtQuick Scenegraph?</strong></p>\n<p>This question came up several times, so I’ll try to answer here. I think an issue we’ve always face<strong></strong>d with QGraphicsView is that it was a tool that was used for too many things, and in the end it was hard to optimize it for a single use case without hindering the other use cases. As the name implies, the Qt Quick Scenegraph is built from the bottom up to make QML applications run fast, and it’s very good at doing that. For accelerating the CSS 3D/animation scene, there are a lot of rules and details that need to be applied in order to make it not just fast, but also correct and compliant to the WebKit CSS tests. In our case, the public API is CSS3, and making the code go through another public API (such as QGraphicsView or Qt Quick Scenegraph) adds complexity that is not needed. We want to let the QtQuick scenegraph do what it’s best at, and provide the optimal code path for CSS to render. Those two don’t necessarily have to match. Anyway, it was a tough choice that we didn’t take lightly, and we’ll revise it again if the circumstances change.</p>\n<p><strong>What’s next?</strong></p>\n<p>There’s tons of problems to solve, and a few people are already hacking away on solving them. I hope this “TODO” list off the top of my would help understand where we are.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Serializing transform/opacity animations – that part was not upstreamed yet, so right now we pass IPC messages with layer-tree information for every animation frame. It’s, however, in the works.</li>\n<li>Video – We don’t currently connect video with accelerated compositing. This is necessary for doing full-screen video “the right way”, and also if we want to accelerate in-page video without reading the pixels for every frame.</li>\n<li>WebGL – this is an interesting problem to solve in WebKit2, especially on Linux. We’ll have to figure out how to efficiently composite the results of WebGL, drawing into X11 in the web process, with the GL context running in the UI process. Chromium has already done some interesting things in that field that we can look at.</li>\n<li>Reflections – this is an underused CSS3 feature that requires heaps of code to support it efficiently… we currently don’t pass all the tests for reflections with compositing, and it’s a subject in itself.</li>\n<li>CSS shaders – right now it’s not implemented at all in WebKit, but once it does we need to hook it into the WebKit2 serialization and to TextureMapper.</li>\n<li>Exploring direct compositing of other elements – for example, can we use shaders for text or gradients in places where it makes sense?</li>\n<li>Tidbits of testing, fixing and optimizations are always needed and always welcome.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/kiss-off-lyrics-violent-femmes/0292f53e448fc82b482568b5001ff73e\">Eight, eight, I forgot what eight was for.</a></li>\n<li>Accelerate 4-dimensional transforms for CSS4.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>LayoutTests/compositing is a good place to start if you want to see what’s possible with compositing and what works/doesn’t work with our implementation.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>"

I have three main problems with the switch:</p>\n<p><strong>POSIX compliance as an argument</strong></p>\n<p>Complying to standards is a really good thing. But when everybody is ignoring the standard because they want the comfort of newer features, maybe it’s a sign that the standard should be updated to include those newer features. Most of the <em>bashims</em> used everywhere in scripts were signifiant improvements, like the ability to write:<br>\n<code>cp {short1/path1,short2/path2}/very/long/common/path/to/a/file</code><br>\ninstead of:<br>\n<code>cp short1/path1/very/long/common/path/to/a/file short2/path2/very/long/common/path/to/a/file</code></p>\n<p><strong>The option to improve bash was not fully explored</strong></p>\n<p>We started with the premise that <em>bash is bloated, slow, and cannot be improved</em>. Maybe you can help me with that, but I could only find a few simplistic benchmarks comparing dash and bash, and I could not find any analysis of why bash is slow, and why it cannot be improved.<br>\nOne of the obvious problems is that bash is also an interactive shell, and is linked to ncurses and terminfo, which increases the startup time. But have we investigated the possibility to have a /bin/bash-non-interactive binary that would not be linked to ncurses?</p>\n<p><strong>The change was brought to users</strong></p>\n<p>While it is OK for Debian (or Ubuntu, in that case, since that change was done in Ubuntu first) to force its developers to use POSIX-compliant scripts, the switch could have been made only to Debian-created scripts (by switching them from a /bin/sh shebang to a /bin/dash shebang, for example). I have trouble justifying that this change was forced on users as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Next: linker changes</strong></p>\n<p>… and we are doing it again. A <a href=\"http://wiki.debian.org/ToolChain/DSOLinking\">set of linker changes</a> (see also <a href=\"https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NattyNarwhal/ToolchainTransition\">the Ubuntu page</a>) was already <a href=\"https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/foundations-n-dso-linking\">done in Ubuntu</a>, and is very likely to be done in Debian as well. This switch requires deep changes in some buildsystems (it requires ordering of libraries and forbids indirect dependencies), and is rather painful (<a href=\"https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2011-March/032632.html\">it was reverted before the Ubuntu 11.04 release because it was not possible to fix all the packages during the natty release cycle</a>, but is <a href=\"https://wiki.ubuntu.com/OneiricOcelot/ReleaseNotes#GCC_4.6_Toolchain\">done in the 11.10 release</a>). Of course, there are justifications for this change. But I’m not sure that it’s worth all the trouble created for users.</p>"

So, during mine, I suggested\nhim to be a next \"victim\". As he couldn't interview himself, I\nvolunteered for this.\n</p><p>\nAs you'll see below, Raphaël (who's a friend of mine as I'm a friend\nof his) likes to speak and that shows in the length of his answers…\n:-) but you always know more about Debian when reading his blog posts,\nbooks, mails, etc. I personnally think that he is among the best\npromoters of the project for years and it was a pleasure for me to\nconduct this interview.\n</p><p>\nMy questions are in bold, the rest is by Raphaël.\n</p><p>\n<b>Who are you?</b>\n</p><p>\nHi, Raphaël Hertzog, I'm a 32 years old French Debian developer who is\nmarried and who has a 2-year old son. I'm running my own company (<a href=\"http://www.freexian.com\">Freexian</a>) since 2005, I started\nit 3 years after the end of my computer science studies. I'm also a very\nproud author of the <a href=\"http://raphaelhertzog.fr/livre/cahier-admin-debian\">Cahier de\nl'Admin Debian</a>, a French book about Debian.\n</p><p>\n<b>You often wrote about your attempts to make your living partly, if\nnot completely, out of your Debian work. Can you describe the way\nyou're trying to do this?</b>\n</p><p>\nMy first try has been with Freexian. I always advertised this company\nas being specialized in Debian GNU/Linux. While Freexian is successful\nenough to provide me a decent income, I'm not really satisfied with the\nresult because very few of my contracts are about improving Debian. I\nuse Debian daily for the benefit of my customers, writing new customer\nspecific (embedded) software, deploying a service on Debian servers, etc.\nBut except for the occasional bugfix, all this work does not improve\nDebian (the only exception has been the dpkg multiarch implementation\nwork sponsored by Linaro).\n</p><p>\nThe positive side is that I don't need to fill my entire schedule to earn\nenough money to live. So I'm regularly taking some days off work to be\nable to contribute to Debian. This is a freedom that I enjoy...\n</p><p>\nMy French book has also been a bestseller and —depending on the years—\nthe royalties represented between 1 and 2 months of supplementary time\nthat I can spend on Debian (that is between 2000 and 4000 EUR of income).\n</p><p>\nNow since last year, I decided to actively work towards my goal of making\na living out of my Debian work. I want to build on what has been most\nsuccessful for me up to now, that is my book. My strategy has been to\nbuild an audience around my blog: with a direct contact with my readers I\nhave the opportunity to sell e-books, and without any intermediary taking\nthe biggest part of the price, I don't need a very large audience to be\nsuccessful.\n</p><p>\nI have also been experiencing micro-donations with Flattr, people who are\nenjoying my articles on my blog can use it to give a few cents for each\narticle they find useful. With a large enough userbase, this could fund\nfree documentation and would avoid the need for commercial e-books but\nwe're not there currently and I don't know if it will ever reach the\ncritical mass.\n</p><p>\nLast but not least, I'm soliciting donations for my Debian work on the\nsidebar of my blog, and I have the chance to a have a <a href=\"http://raphaelhertzog.com/go/donate/\">few (regular) donators</a>.\n</p><p>\n<b>You're a proud father since last year. How do you manage your\ncommitment to the project with your family life?</b>\n</p><p>\nThere are few things that I put above Debian in my life, but my family\ncertainly is. I try to handle most of my Debian duties during work\nhours so that I can spend time with my family on evenings and during\nweek-ends but in truth I never really disconnect from Debian. It happens\nquite often that I say to my wife “I'll come in a few minutes, let me\nfinish this” and then I end up responding to a Debian mail, or an IRC\nquery and take 30 minutes instead of the 5 expected ones. I try hard to\navoid this but it's difficult. Luckily for me, my wife is very supportive\nof my Debian involvement and knows me well...\n</p><p>\nBy the way my wife is using Debian on her computer, and my son has already played\nwith <a href=\"http://doudoulinux.org\">DoudouLinux</a> (a Debian derivative!).\n</p><p>\n<b>Have you already been accused of self-promotion in your writings? If\n that would ever happen, what would you answer to that?</b>\n</p><p>\nYes, more than once. I am proud of what I do for Debian, I enjoy sharing\nthe result of my work. Because of this, some people believe that I'm\nselfish and egocentric. And this has somewhat increased since I have been\nsoliciting donations: for me it's important to be transparent towards\ndonators so that they see what I really do for Debian. But some people\nhave the feeling that I'm getting undeserved attention and that I bring\neverything towards my own person. On the other side, as an author, I'm a\npublic figure who is definitely seeking some attention...\n</p><p>\nI don't have any miraculous answer, we are a large and diverse community,\nit's next to impossible to please everybody. I listen to all the concerns\nthat people bring forward, I take them into account as much as possible,\nin particular when I believe they are reasonable/well justified, or when\nthey come from people that I highly respect. But sometimes I have to plainly\nignore them too... in particular when they are trying to impose their\nown political view on a topic that's not directly related to the only\nvalue that we all share: the social contract.\n</p><p>\nContributing to Debian is a challenge, we all have to make efforts to\nput aside our differences and to concentrate on the work that brings\nus closer to the best free software operating system ever built.\n</p><p>\n<b>You recently launched a campaign to free out the soon-to-be-published\n\"Debian Administrator Handbook\", an English version of your\nwell-known book about Debian in French. Can you tell us more about\nthis project?</b>\n</p><p>\nMy French book has been very successful at helping people to get started\nwith Debian, and like I already explained, it was also effective to fund a\npart of my Debian work. So I wanted to make it available world-wide by\npublishing an English translation of it. I tried to find an\nEnglish-speaking editor willing to take on the challenge but I found none\ninterested.\n</p><p>\nNot put off by a setback, Roland (my co-author) and I decided to negotiate\nwith our French editor Eyrolles to recuperate the necessary rights to\ntranslate the book into English. Handling everything ourselves represents\na lot of work, but it also means that we have the freedom required to decide\nof the license of the resulting book. We would love to see it under\na license compatible with the Debian Free Software Guidelines.\n</p><p>\nBut at the same time we firmly believe that we deserve a reasonable\nmonetary compensation for the work on the book, so we conditioned its\nliberation to a predefined amount of money (25 K€) in what we call the\n\"liberation fund\". And since we wanted to be sure that we would have the\nrequired means to complete the translation, we used a crowfunding platform\nto seek support of people interested by the book. With such a platform\nyou're only debited if the minimal requested amount is reached.  Anyone\ncan participate, pre-order the book and/or put some money in the\nliberation fund.\n</p><p>\nAs of today, we already reached the minimal funding goal (15 K€) so the\nbook translation will happen. But the liberation target has not yet been\nreached so we don't know yet if the book will be free from the start...\nyou can follow the progress right on the <a href=\"http://www.ulule.com/debian-handbook/\">fundraising page</a> or\non the <a href=\"http://debian-handbook.info\">website dedicated to the\nbook</a>.\n</p><p>\nPS: If you want to contribute to this project and also make a donation\nto Debian at the same time, you should check out <a href=\"http://debian-handbook.info/support-debian/\">this page</a>.\n</p><p>\n<b>You're one of the main developers of dpkg, a critical tool for\nDebian systems. Can you tell us more about the current development\nchallenges it is facing? What will be the new dpkg features for\nwheezy?</b>\n</p><p>\nThe current challenges are not really technical. dpkg is a relatively\nmature piece of software and it will continue to work for the foreseeable\nfuture without needing much maintenance work.\n</p><p>\nThe real challenge is trying to setup a healthy developement community\naround it so that we can keep tackling new interesting problems (there are\nmany listed in the <a href=\"http://wiki.debian.org/Teams/Dpkg/RoadMap\">roadmap</a> and in\nthe <a href=\"http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?repeatmerged=no&amp;src=dpkg\">225 wishlist bugs</a>).\n</p><p>\nThere is a real problem of leadership and communication in the current\nteam. We used to be three, and we're only two nowadays. Guillem is the\nlegitimate leader since he's involved in dpkg's developement since early\n2006 while I joined only in <a href=\"http://packages.debian.org/changelogs/pool/main/d/dpkg/current/changelog#version1.14.8\">late 2007</a>. But in the last 4 years, we did not manage to recruit anyone\nelse on the team. Some persons tried to contribute significant new\nfeatures (like Sean Finney with a rework of the way we handle\nconfiguration files) but they gave up frustrated after a while because we\ndid not manage to review their work (and discuss the design) in any\nreasonable timeframe. Another famous case is Ian Jackson with his trigger\nwork. His work got merged, but so late that in the mean time he blew up\nwhile trying to <a href=\"http://lists.debian.org/debian-dpkg/2008/03/msg00058.html\">hijack\nthe maintenance of dpkg</a>.\n</p><p>\nFor a long time I was concentrating my work on the Perl part of dpkg (aka\ndpkg-dev mainly), so I did not feel qualified to review and merge work\nrelated to the C part and I was just a worried observator of this\nsituation. I tried to improve it by setting up some basic\n<a href=\"http://wiki.debian.org/Teams/Dpkg/ReviewMergeQueue\">review\ninfrastructure</a>, it should have brought some lisibility to the status\nof each change left to be reviewed... but it has not been used\nand it changed nothing.\n</p><p>\nOver the years, I became much more interested in the C part. My first big\ncontribution in C has been the <a href=\"http://raphaelhertzog.com/2010/05/27/rewriting-update-alternatives-in-c/\">rewrite of update-alternatives</a> (from Perl\nto C). I made other small changes in between, but at the start of this\nyear I had this great opportunity to work on the multiarch implementation\n(FYI, <a href=\"http://wiki.debian.org/Multiarch/\">multiarch</a> is the\npossibility to mix packages from several architectures on a single\nsystem). This really forced me to jump into the C codebase and learn a lot about\nhow dpkg is implemented. Thanks to this I have been able to tackle other\nsmall projects (like the <a href=\"http://raphaelhertzog.com/2011/05/30/trying-to-make-dpkg-triggers-more-useful-and-less-painful/\">improved triggers</a>).\n</p><p>\nThis would be all great if my multiarch work was already merged, but\nit's not. It's a large work, I do not mind waiting a bit in particular\nsince Guillem is a highly skilled C programmer. His sharp analysis of new\ndesigns are invaluable, when he reviews code he always finds something to\nimprove. I learnt a lot just by reviewing the code he wrote over the\nyears.\n</p><p>\nThat said I have been waiting since April without almost no updates from\nhim. With the release team <a href=\"http://lists.debian.org/debian-dpkg/2011/10/msg00050.html\">asking us\nto hurry up</a>, the situation is getting somewhat strained as I really\nwant to see multiarch in Wheezy and I do not really want to short-circuit\nGuillem.\n</p><p>\nHum, I may have drifted a bit from your original question... what great\nnew features can people expect? Well multiarch is supposed to be the big\nnew feature, apart from that there aren't many things that matter to the\nend users. But there are already quite a few <a href=\"http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2011/09/msg00001.html\">changes\nthat are of interest to package maintainers</a> (like hardened build\nflags, source package improvements, improved triggers, …).\n</p><p>\n<b>What's the biggest problem of Debian?</b>\n</p><p>\nManicheism and a tendency to quickly polarize the discussions. In reality,\nthere are very few situations where everything is all good or all bad.\n</p><p>\nEver since I have read <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Seven_Habits_of_Highly_Effective_People\">The 7\nHabits of Highly Effective People</a> I try hard to put into practice the\nhabits of “interdependence”. Instead of having only my point of view in\nmind, I try to understand the motivations from the other party (“Seek\nFirst to Understand, Then to be Understood”) in order to be able to put\nforward solutions acceptable to both parties (“Think Win-Win”).\n</p><p>\nI highly recommend this book to anyone. And I invite everybody to\nat least try to follow those simple advices. \n</p><p>\n<b>Is there someone in Debian you admire for their contributions?</b>\n</p><p>\nThere are many and I can't give an exhaustive list... here are some\nthat I would like to highlight (in no particular order):\n</p><ul>\n<li>Niels Thykier for the work he puts into Lintian,\nand his recent work on a <a href=\"http://nthykier.wordpress.com/?p=78\">britney test-suite</a> (the\nsoftware that creates testing out of unstable);</li>\n<li>Joachim Breitner for his <a href=\"http://www.joachim-breitner.de/blog/archives/515-SAT-solving-the-testing-transition-problem.html\">britney reimplementation using a SAT\nsolver</a>;</li>\n<li>Adam D. Barrat for his work on britney2;</li>\n<li>All the release team members who take care of an endless stream of\ntransitions;</li>\n<li>Christoph Berg for his continuous work over the years on various\nQA infrastructure (DDPO, Mole, …);</li>\n<li>Enrico Zini for the way he helped reform the New Member process\nwithout any big disruption;</li>\n<li>Russ Allbery for his Debian Policy work and for being a model in\nterms of how we should interact on Debian mailing lists;</li>\n<li>Stefano Zacchiroli for being the most active leader that I have ever\nseen, and for the way he tries to steer important discussions\nto a constructive conclusion.</li>\n<li>etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nMost of those people are working on improving Debian's infrastructure\nso that we can all be more effective and do an even better work. This kind\nof work is not always very visible but it's crucial to Debian's future.\n</p><p>\nThank you to Raphaël for the time spent answering my questions. I\nhope you enjoyed reading his answers as I did. And, anyway, it was fun\nto just play the game \"the other way\".</p>"

As stated in its\ndescription, the problem is not really new: a complete <abbr title=\"Secure Socket Layer\"><span>SSL</span></abbr> handshake\nimplies costly cryptographic computations.</p>\n<p>There are two different aspects in the presented attack:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The computation cost of an handshake is more important on the\n   server side than on the client side.

Since the <abbr title=\"Denial of service\">DoS</abbr> tool from <abbr title=\"The Hacker&#39;s Choice\"><span>THC</span></abbr> relies heavily on\nrenegotiation, the most obvious one is to disable this mechanism on\nthe server side but we will explore other possibilities.</p>\n<h2>Disabling <abbr title=\"Secure Socket Layer\"><span>SSL</span></abbr> renegotiation</h2>\n<p>Tackling the second problem seems easy: just disable <abbr title=\"Secure Socket Layer\"><span>SSL</span></abbr>\nrenegotiation. It is hardly needed: a server can trigger a\nrenegotiation to ask a client to present a certificate but a client\nusually does not have any reason to trigger one. Because of a\n<a href=\"http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2009-3555\" title=\"CVE-2009-3555\">past vulnerability in <abbr title=\"Secure Socket Layer\"><abbr title=\"Secure Socket Layer\"><span>SSL</span></abbr></abbr> renegotiation</a>, recent\nversion of <em>Apache</em> and <em>nginx</em> just forbid it, even when the\n<a href=\"http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5746\" title=\"RFC 5746: TLS Renegotiation Indication Extension\">non-vulnerable version</a> is available.</p>\n<p><code>openssl s_client</code> can be used to test if <abbr title=\"Secure Socket Layer\"><span>SSL</span></abbr> renegotiation is really\ndisabled.

For example, your web server may be too old to propose such\nan option. Since those renegotiations should not happen often, a\nworkaround is to limit them.</p>\n<p>When the flaw was first advertised, <a href=\"http://www.f5.com/\" title=\"F5 Networks website\">F5 Networks</a> provided a way\nto configure such a limitation with an iRule on their load-balancers. We\ncan do something similar with just Netfilter. We can spot most <span>TCP</span>\npackets triggering such a renegotiation by looking for encrypted <abbr title=\"Transport Layer Security\"><span>TLS</span></abbr>\nhandshake record. They may happen in a regular handshake but in this\ncase, they usually are not at the beginning of the <span>TCP</span> payload. There\nis no field saying if a <abbr title=\"Transport Layer Security\"><span>TLS</span></abbr> record is encrypted or not (<abbr title=\"Transport Layer Security\"><span>TLS</span></abbr> is\nstateful for this purpose). Therefore, we have to use some\nheuristics. If the handshake type is unknown, we assume that this is\nan encrypted record. Moreover, renegotiation requests are usually\nencapsulated in a <span>TCP</span> packet flagged with “push”.</p>\n<div><pre><span># Access to <span>TCP</span> payload (if not fragmented)</span>\n<span>payload</span><span>=</span><span>&quot;0 &gt;&gt; 22 <span>&amp;</span> 0x3C @ 12 &gt;&gt; 26 <span>&amp;</span> 0x3C @\"</span>\niptables -A LIMIT_RENEGOCIATION <span>\\</span>\n    -p tcp --dport 443 <span>\\</span>\n    --tcp-flags <span>SYN</span>,<span>FIN</span>,<span>RST</span>,<span>PSH</span> <span>PSH</span> <span>\\</span>\n    -m u32 <span>\\</span>\n    --u32 <span>&quot;$payload 0 &gt;&gt; 8 = 0x160300:0x160303 &amp;&amp; $payload 2 <span>&amp;</span> 0xFF = 3:10,17:19,21:255\"</span> <span>\\</span>\n    -m hashlimit <span>\\</span>\n    --hashlimit-above 5/minute --hashlimit-burst 3 <span>\\</span>\n    --hashlimit-mode srcip --hashlimit-name ssl-reneg <span>\\</span>\n    -j <span>DROP</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>The use of <code>u32</code> match is a bit difficult to read.

It only works if there is no\nfragmentation. Then, we check if we have a handshake (<code>0x16</code>) and if\nwe recognise <abbr title=\"Transport Layer Security\"><span>TLS</span></abbr> version (<code>0x0300</code>, <code>0x0301</code>, <code>0x0302</code> or\n<code>0x0303</code>).

Here is a <abbr title=\"Secure Socket Layer\"><span>SSL</span></abbr> handshake when using a cipher suite\nlike <code>AES256-SHA</code>:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://d1g3mdmxf8zbo9.cloudfront.net/images/benchs-ssl/ssl-handshake.png\" alt=\"SSL full handshake\" title=\"Full SSL handshake\"></p>\n<p>When sending the <em>Client Key Exchange</em> message, the client will\n<strong>encrypt</strong> <abbr title=\"Transport Layer Security\"><span>TLS</span></abbr> version and 46 random bytes with the public key of the\ncertificate sent by the server in its <em>Certificate</em> message. The\nserver will have to <strong>decrypt</strong> this message with her private\nkey. Those are the two most expensive operations in the\nhandshake. Encryption and decryption are done with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivest_Shamir_Adleman\" title=\"Article on Wikipedia for RSA\"><abbr title=\"Rivest Shamir Adleman\"><abbr title=\"Rivest Shamir Adleman\"><span>RSA</span></abbr></abbr></a> (because\nof the selected cipher suite). To understand why decryption is more\nexpensive than encryption, let me explain how <abbr title=\"Rivest Shamir Adleman\"><span>RSA</span></abbr> works.</p>\n<p>First, the server needs a public and a private key. Here are the main\nsteps to generate them:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Pick two random distinct <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number\" title=\"Article on Wikipedia for prime numbers\">prime numbers</a> ·p· and ·q·, each\n    roughly the same size.</li>\n<li>Compute ·n=pq·. It is the <em>modulus</em>.</li>\n<li>Compute ·\\varphi(n)=(p-1)(q-1)·.</li>\n<li>Choose an integer ·e· such that ·1&lt;e&lt;\\varphi(n)· and\n    ·\\gcd(\\varphi(n),e) = 1· (i.e. ·e· and ·\\varphi(n)· are\n    <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coprime\" title=\"Article on Wikipedia for coprime numbers\">coprime</a>). It is the <em>public exponent</em>.</li>\n<li>Compute ·d=e^{-1}\\mod\\varphi(n)·. It is the <em>private key\n    exponent</em>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The <strong>public key</strong> is ·(n,e)· while the <strong>private key</strong> is ·(n,d)·. A\nmessage to be encrypted is first turned into an integer ·m&lt;n· (with\nsome appropriate padding). It is then encrypted to a ciphered message\n·c· with the public key and should only be decrypted with the private key:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>·c=m^e\\mod n·  (encryption)</li>\n<li>·m=c^d\\mod n·  (decryption)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, why is decryption more expensive? In fact, the key pair is not\nreally generated like I said above. Usually, ·e· is a small fixed\nprime number with a lot of 0, like 17 (<code>0x11</code>) or 65537 (<code>0x10001</code>)\nand ·p· and ·q· are choosen such that ·\\varphi(n)· is coprime with\n·e·. This allows encryption to be fast using\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation_by_squaring\" title=\"Article on Wikipedia for exponentiation by squaring\">exponentiation by squaring</a>. On the other hand, its inverse\n·d· is a big number with no special property and therefore,\nexponentiation is more costly and slow.</p>\n<p>Instead of computing ·d· from ·e·, it is possible to choose ·d· and\ncompute ·e·. We could choose ·d· to be small and coprime with\n·\\varphi(n)· and then compute ·e=d^{-1}\\mod\\varphi(n)· and get\nblazingly fast decryption. Unfortunately, there are two problems with this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Most <abbr title=\"Secure Socket Layer\"><span>SSL</span></abbr> implementation expects ·e· to be a 32bit integer.</li>\n<li>If ·d· is too small (less than one-quarter as many bits as the\n   modulus ·n·), it can be\n   <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener%27s_Attack\" title=\"Article on Wikipedia for Wiener&#39;s attack\">computed efficiently from the public key</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Therefore, we cannot use a small private exponent. The best we can do\nis to choose the public exponent to be ·e’=4294967291· (the biggest\nprime 32bit number and it contains only one 0). However, there is no\nchange as you can see on our comparative plot.</p>\n<p>To summarize, no real solution here. You need to allow <abbr title=\"Rivest Shamir Adleman\"><span>RSA</span></abbr> cipher\nsuites and there is no way to improve the computational ratio between\nthe server and the client with such a cipher suite.</p>\n<h1>Things get worse</h1>\n<p>Shortly after the release the <a href=\"http://www.thc.org/thc-ssl-dos/\" title=\"THC-SSL-DOS tool\">denial of service tool</a>, Eric\nRescorla<sup><a href=\"http://vincent.bernat.im/en/blog/atom.xml#fn:0\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a></sup> published a\n<a href=\"http://www.educatedguesswork.org/2011/10/ssltls_and_computational_dos.html\" title=\"Educated Guesswork: SSL/TLS and Computational DoS\">good analysis on the impact of such a tool</a>. He asks\nhimself about the efficiency to use renegotiation for such an attack:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What you should be asking at this point is whether a computational <abbr title=\"Denial of service\">DoS</abbr>\nattack based on renegotiation is any better for the attacker than a\ncomputational <abbr title=\"Denial of service\">DoS</abbr> attack based on multiple connections. The way we\nmeasure this is by the ratio of the work the attacker has to do to the\nwork that the server has to do. I’ve never seen any actual\nmeasurements here (and the <abbr title=\"The Hacker&#39;s Choice\"><span>THC</span></abbr> guys don’t present any), but some back\nof the envelope calculations suggest that the difference is small.</p>\n<p>If I want to mount the old, multiple connection attack, I need to\nincur the following costs:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Do the <span>TCP</span> handshake (3 packets)</li>\n<li>Send the <abbr title=\"Secure Socket Layer\"><span>SSL</span></abbr>/<abbr title=\"Transport Layer Security\"><span>TLS</span></abbr> <em>ClientHello</em> (1 packet). This can be a canned message.</li>\n<li>Send the <abbr title=\"Secure Socket Layer\"><span>SSL</span></abbr>/<abbr title=\"Transport Layer Security\"><span>TLS</span></abbr> <em>ClientKeyExchange</em>, <em>ChangeCipherSpec</em>,\n    <em>Finished</em> messages (1 packet). These can also be canned.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Note that I don’t need to parse any <abbr title=\"Secure Socket Layer\"><span>SSL</span></abbr>/<abbr title=\"Transport Layer Security\"><span>TLS</span></abbr> messages from the server,\nand I don’t need to do any cryptography. I’m just going to send the\nserver junk anyway, so I can (for instance) send the same bogus\n<em>ClientKeyExchange</em> and <em>Finished</em> every time. The server can’t find\nout that they are bogus until it’s done the expensive part. So,\nroughly speaking, this attack consists of sending a bunch of canned\npackets in order to force the server to do one <abbr title=\"Rivest Shamir Adleman\"><span>RSA</span></abbr> decryption.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I have written a\n<a href=\"https://github.com/vincentbernat/ssl-dos/blob/master/brute-shake.c\" title=\"Tool to emit massive parallel SSL handshakes\">quick proof of concept of such a tool</a>. To avoid any\nabuse, it will only work if the server supports <code>NULL-MD5</code>\ncipher suite. No sane server in the wild will support such a\ncipher. You need to configure your web server to support it before\nusing this tool.</p>\n<p>While Eric explains that there is no need to parse any <abbr title=\"Secure Socket Layer\"><span>SSL</span></abbr>/<abbr title=\"Transport Layer Security\"><span>TLS</span></abbr>\nmessages, I have found that if the key exchange message is sent before\nthe server send the answer, the connection will be aborted. Therefore,\nI quickly parse the server’s answer to check if I can continue. Eric\nalso says a bogus key exchange message can be sent since the server\nwill have to decrypt it before discovering it is bogus. I have choosen\nto build a valid key exchange message during the first handshake\n(using the certificate presented by the server) and replay it on\nsubsequent handshakes because I think the server may dismiss the\nmessage before the computation is complete (for example, if the size\ndoes not match the size of the certificate).</p>\n<p>With such a tool and 2048bit <abbr title=\"Rivest Shamir Adleman\"><span>RSA</span></abbr> certificate, a server is using 100\ntimes more processing power than the client. Unfortunately, this means\nthat most solutions, except rate limiting, exposed on this page\nmay just be ineffective.</p>\n<div>\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>However, since this rule relies on source <span>IP</span> to identify the\n  attacker, the risk of false positive is real.

      "content" : "<h2>Dear lazyweb,</h2>\n\n<p>Both on dri-devel and at the most recent Kernel Summit, the idea of a KMS based console program came up yet again.  So in the interest of facilitating the lazyweb to write one, I thought I’d provide a review of what it takes to write a simple KMS program that ties in with GL, just in case anyone wants to port the VTE widget and give me my VTs on a cube. :)  The ideal situation would be one where a distro could set CONFIG_VT=n and have userspace provide all console services, including support for the various types of input and output that exist in the wild today.  The only thing that ought to be left to the kernel is spitting out panic information somehow.  That means having a very simple text drawing layer remain, and a way for the kernel to flip to the latest kernel console buffer (today these functions are provided by fbcon and the DRM KMS layer, but if a userspace console service existed, we could likely clean them up quite a bit, and remove the need for the full VT and fb layers to be compiled in).</p>\n\n<h2>Initialization</h2>\n\n<p>One of the first things any DRM based program must do is open the DRI device:</p>\n<pre>int fd;\nfd = open(\"/dev/dri/card0\", O_RDWR);\n</pre>\n<p>You’ll need to save that fd for use with any later DRM call, including the ones we’ll need to get display resources.  The path to the device may vary by distribution or configuration (e.g. with a multi-card setup), so take care to report sensible error strings if things go wrong.</p>\n\n<p>The next step is to initialize the GBM library.  GBM (for Generic Buffer Management) is a simple library to abstract buffers that will be used with Mesa.  We’ll use the handle it creates to initialize EGL and to create render target buffers.</p>\n<pre>struct gbm_device *gbm;\ngbm = gbm_create_device(fd);\n</pre>\n\n<p>Then we get EGL into shape:</p>\n<pre>EGLDisplay dpy;\ndpy = eglGetDisplay(gbm);\n</pre>\n\n<p>We’ll need to hang on to both the GBM device handle and the EGL display handle as well, since most of the calls we make will need them.  What follows is more EGL init.</p>\n<pre>EGLint major, minor;\nconst char *ver, *extensions;\neglInitialize(dpy, &amp;major, &amp;minor);\nver = eglQueryString(dpy, EGL_VERSION);\nextensions = eglQueryString(dpy, EGL_EXTENSIONS);\n</pre>\n\n<p>Now that we have the extensions string, we need to check and make sure the EGL_KHR_surfaceless_opengl extension is available, since it’s what we’ll use to avoid the need for a full windowing system, which would normally provide us with pixmaps and windows to turn into EGL surfaces.</p>\n\n<pre>if (!strstr(extensions, \"EGL_KHR_surfaceless_opengl\")) {\n    fprintf(stderr, \"no surfaceless support, cannot initialize\\n\");\n    exit(-1);\n}\n</pre>\n\n<p>And now we’re finally ready to see what outputs are available for us to use.  There are several good references for KMS output handling:  the DDX drivers for radeon, nouveau, and intel, and testdisplay.c in the intel-gpu-tools package.  (The below is taken from eglkms.c in the mesa-demos package.)</p>\n\n<pre>    drmModeRes *resources;\n    drmModeConnector *connector;\n    drmModeEncoder *encoder;\n    int i;\n \n    /* Find the first available connector with modes */\n \n    resources = drmModeGetResources(fd);\n    if (!resources) {\n        fprintf(stderr, &quot;drmModeGetResources failed\\n&quot;);\n        return;\n    }\n \n    for (i = 0; i &lt; resources-&gt;count_connectors; i++) {\n        connector = drmModeGetConnector(fd, resources-&gt;connectors[i]);\n        if (connector == NULL)\n            continue;\n \n        if (connector-&gt;connection == DRM_MODE_CONNECTED &amp;&amp;\n            connector-&gt;count_modes &gt; 0)\n            break;\n \n        drmModeFreeConnector(connector);\n    }\n \n    if (i == resources-&gt;count_connectors) {\n        fprintf(stderr, &quot;No currently active connector found.\\n&quot;);\n        return;\n    }\n \n    for (i = 0; i &lt; resources-&gt;count_encoders; i++) {\n        encoder = drmModeGetEncoder(fd, resources-&gt;encoders[i]);\n \n        if (encoder == NULL)\n  \t continue;\n \n       if (encoder-&gt;encoder_id == connector-&gt;encoder_id)\n \t break;\n \n       drmModeFreeEncoder(encoder);\n    }\n</pre>\n\n<p>At this point we have connector, encoder, and mode structures we’ll use to put something on the display later.</p>\n\n<h2>Drawing &amp; displaying</h2>\n\n<p>We’ve initialized EGL, but we need to bind an API and create a context.  In this case, we’ll use OpenGL.</p>\n<pre>    EGLContext ctx;\n\n    eglBindAPI(EGL_OPENGL_API);\n    ctx = eglCreateContext(dpy, NULL, EGL_NO_CONTEXT, NULL);\n\n    eglMakeCurrent(dpy, EGL_NO_SURFACE, EGL_NO_SURFACE, ctx);\n</pre>\n\n<p>Now we have a fully functional KMS and EGL stack and it’s time for a little bit of glue magic.  We need to create some buffers using GBM and bind them into EGL images that we can use as renderbuffers.</p>\n\n<pre>    EGLImageKHR image;\n    struct gbm_bo *bo;\n    GLuint fb, color_rb, depth_rb;\n    uint32_t handle, stride;\n\n    /* Create a full screen buffer for use as a render target */\n    bo = gbm_bo_create(gbm, mode.hdisplay, mode.vdisplay, GBM_BO_FORMAT_XRGB888, GBM_BO_USE_SCANOUT | GBM_BO_USE_RENDERING);\n\n    glGenFramebuffers(1, &amp;fb);\n    glBindFramebuffer(GL_FRAMEBUFFER_EXT, fb);\n\n    handle = gbm_bo_get_handle(bo).u32;\n    stride = gbm_bo_get_pitch(bo);\n\n    image = eglCreateImageKHR(dpy, NULL, EGL_NATIVE_PIXMAP_KHR, bo, NULL);\n\n    /* Set up render buffer... */\n    glGenRenderbuffers(1, &amp;color_rb);\n    glBindRenderbuffer(GL_RENDERBUFFER_EXT, color_rb);\n    glEGLImageTargetRenderbufferStorageOES(GL_RENDERBUFFER, image);\n    glFramebufferRenderbufferEXT(GL_FRAMEBUFFER_EXT, GL_COLOR_ATTACHMENT0_EXT, GL_RENDERBUFFER_EXT, color_rb);\n\n    /* and depth buffer */\n    glGenRenderbuffers(1, &amp;depth_rb);\n    glBindRenderbuffer(GL_RENDERBUFFER_EXT, depth_rb);\n    glRenderbufferStorage(GL_RENDERBUFFER_EXT, GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT, mode.hdisplay, mode.vdisplay);\n    glFramebufferRenderbufferEXT(GL_FRAMEBUFFER_EXT, GL_DEPTH_ATTACHMENT_EXT, GL_RENDERBUFFER_EXT, depth_rb);\n\n    if (glCheckFramebufferStatusEXT(GL_FRAMEBUFFER_EXT)) != GL_FRAMEBUFFER_COMPLETE) {\n        fprintf(stderr, &quot;something bad happened\\n&quot;);\n        exit(-1);\n    }\n</pre>\n\n<p>At this point, you’re all ready to start rendering using standard GL calls.  Note that since we don’t have a window system or a window bound, we won’t be using eglSwapBuffers() to display the final renderbuffer.  But we still need to make sure the rendering is finished before we display it, so we can use glFinish() or some out of band synchronization mechanism (TBD) to ensure our rendering is complete before we display the new buffer.</p>\n\n<p>Assuming we have something presentable, we can now try to display it:</p>\n\n<pre>    uint32_t crtc;\n\n    /* Create a KMS framebuffer handle to set a mode with */\n    drmModeAddFB(fd, mode.hdisplay, mode.vdisplay, 24, 32, stride, handle, &amp;fb_id);\n\n    drmModeSetCrtc(fd, encoder-&gt;crtc_id, fb_id, 0, 0, connector-&gt;connector_id, 1, mode);\n</pre>\n\n<p>In this example, we’re assuming a 24 bit depth buffer with 32 bits per pixel.  That can of course vary, but what’s supported will depend on the chipset (24/32 is fairly common however).  The drmModeSetCrtc call will also take care to simply flip to the fb in question if the mode timings are already programmed and are the same as the mode timings passed into the call.  This allows for a simple page flipping scheme that simply creates two fbs using AddFB (pointing at different buffers) and flips between them with SetCrtc calls in a loop.  Alternately, one can simply draw to the buffer that’s being displayed, if the visibility of partial rendering isn’t a problem.</p>\n\n<h2>DRM master privs and authentication</h2>\n\n<p>I forgot to mention that any program like this must drop DRM master privileges if another app, like X, wants to start up and use the DRM layer.  The calls for this are drmSetMaster(int fd) and drmDropMaster(int fd).  If no other DRM master is present, the SetMaster call should succeed.  And before switching away due to a dbus call or whatever, any console program using the DRM layer should call drmDropMaster to allow the next client to get access to the DRM.  Alternately, the console program could provide a display management API and make X a slave of that interface.  That would also mean providing DRM authentication for other apps wanting to do direct rendering (typically master privs are required for display management, and simple auth privs are required to do command submission).  Wayland is a good example of a display manager that provides this kind of functionality.</p> \n\n<p>And that’s all there is to it, and should be enough to get someone started on kmscon… :)  If you have questions or comments, feel free to bring them up at <a href=\"http://virtuousgeek.orgmailto:dri-devel@lists.freedesktop.org\">dri-devel@lists.freedesktop.org</a>, in the comments section here, or via email to me.</p>"

Android 4.0 adună în același loc lucrurile ce oamenii le apreciază cel mai mult – multitasking simplu, notificări clare, ecrane customizabile, widgeturi alături de o interactivitate puternică și noi modalități de comunicare și sharing.<br>\nAcest articol încearcă să vă ofere detalii cu privire la noul OS în speranța că vă va satisface aproape toate curiozitățile. </p>\n<h3>O interfață rafinată și evoluată</h3>\n<p> Android 4.0 a avut printre ținte scoaterea la suprafață a puterii Android, acțiunile obișnuite devenind mai vizibile, permițându-le utilizatorilor să navigheze mult mai ușor prin gesturi. Animațiile par a fi rafinate iar feedback-ul oferit de sistem provoaca interacțiunea. Ecranele au fost îmbunătățite și au rezoluții mult mai bune ce le sporesc claritatea.  </p>\n<p> Cele trei butoane virtuale a barei de sistem permit navigarea rapidă către comenzile cel mai des folosite – Back, Home și Recent Apps. Această bară de sistem este în continuare prezentă în toate aplicațiile, dar poate fi ascunsă dacă se dorește o experiență full-screen.  </p>\n<div align=\"center\"><a href=\"http://www.worldit.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/lock-lg1.png\"><img src=\"http://www.worldit.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/lock-lg1-168x300.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"Android 4.0 Lock Screen\" width=\"168\" height=\"300\"></a> <a href=\"http://www.worldit.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/home-lg1.png\"><img src=\"http://www.worldit.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/home-lg1-168x300.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"Android 4.0 Home Screen\" width=\"168\" height=\"300\"></a> <a href=\"http://www.worldit.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/tasks-lg1.png\"><img src=\"http://www.worldit.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/tasks-lg1-168x300.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"Android 4.0 Multitasking\" width=\"168\" height=\"300\"></a></div>\n<h4>Multitasking</h4>\n<p> Multitaskingul, un cuvânt cheie în sistemul de operare Android a fost îmbunătățit. Butonul Recent Apps amintit mai devreme permite mutarea de pe o aplicație pe alta direct din bara de sistem, fiecare aplicație fiind caracterizată printr-un thumbnail definit de dezvoltatori. </p>\n<p> Notificările îți permit în continuare să păstrezi contactul permanent cu mesajele primite, melodiile ce sunt ascultate, posibilitatea de vedea update-urile aplicațiilor în timp real etc. Pe ecranele mici, notificațiile sunt în partea de sus a ecranului în vreme ce pe ecranele mari acestea apar în bara de sistem.  </p>\n<h4>Foldere pe ecrane</h4>\n<p> Noul sistem de foldere de pe ecrane oferă utilizatorilor posibilitatea de a grupa aplicațiile și shortcut-urile într-o manieră mai logică, întregul proces realizându-se pe principiu drag &amp; drop. Ai posibilitatea de afla informații despre aplicații, de a le șterge sau de a le lansa. Pe ecranele mici, există un o secțiune de favorite unde utilizatorii pot pune aplicații, foldere și alte obiecte prioritare pentru a le accesa de pe orice ecran.  </p>\n<h4>Widgeturi ce pot fi redimensionate</h4>\n<p> Ecranele din Android 4.0 sunt construite pentru a fi extrem de customizabile. Utilizatorii pot integra conținutul unor aplicații live direct cu ajutorul widgeturilor interactive. Widgeturile îți oferă posibilitatea de a verifica emailul, navigarea prin calendare, ascultarea unor melodii, validarea streamurilor sociale. Pe lângă asta, widgeturile pot fi redimensionate pentru a ocupa mai puțin spațiu sau pentru a pune la dispoziție mai mult conținut.  </p>\n<p> Ecranul de deblocare poate face mai multe acum. Din acea interfață utilizatorul poate sări direct la cameră pentru o fotografie sau poate vedea notificările. Când ascultăm muzică, utilizatorii pot administra melodiile sau chiar vedea albumele.  </p>\n<div align=\"center\"><a href=\"http://www.worldit.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/contact-call-lg1.png\"><img src=\"http://www.worldit.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/contact-call-lg1-168x300.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"Android 4.0 - Contact Call\" width=\"168\" height=\"300\"></a><a href=\"http://www.worldit.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/allapps-lg1.png\"><img src=\"http://www.worldit.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/allapps-lg1-168x300.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"Android 4.0 - All apps\" width=\"168\" height=\"300\"></a><a href=\"http://www.worldit.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/calendar-widget-lg1.png\"><img src=\"http://www.worldit.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/calendar-widget-lg1-168x300.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"Android 4.0 - Widgets\" width=\"168\" height=\"300\"></a></div>\n<h4>Răspuns rapid pentru apelurile telefonice</h4>\n<p> Când suntem apelați de cineva, utilizatorul poate răspunde cu un mesaj text, fără a fi necesară deblocarea telefonului sau răspunderea la apel. Pe ecranul de apeluri, utilizatorul poate alege un mesaj predefinit dintr-o listă de mesaje text, urmată de încheierea apelului. Utilizatorii pot să-și construiască și să administreze propriile mesaje din Setări.  </p>\n<h4>Swipe pentru a respinge notificările</h4>\n<p> Administrarea notificărilor, a aplicațiilor recente și a taburilor din browsere a devenit mai ușoară odată cu introducerea în Android 4.0 sistemului de respingere printr-un simplu swipe cu un deget.  </p>\n<h4>Controlează datele din rețea</h4>\n<p> Cu toții știm de limitările pe care le primim din partea providerilor de servicii de internet mobile. Aceste limitări sunt ucigătoare pentru telefoanele inteligente care sunt consumatori declarați ai benzii de internet pentru conținut streaming, sincronizări, descărcarea unor aplicații etc. Android 4.0 implementează un serviciu pentru a controla mai ușor cantitatea de date transferată.  </p>\n<div align=\"center\"><a href=\"http://www.worldit.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/usage-all-lg1.png\"><img src=\"http://www.worldit.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/usage-all-lg1-168x300.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"Android 4.0 - Bandwith usage\" width=\"168\" height=\"300\"></a> <a href=\"http://www.worldit.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/usage-maps-lg1.png\"><img src=\"http://www.worldit.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/usage-maps-lg1-168x300.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"Android 4.0 - Bandwith usage Maps\" width=\"168\" height=\"300\"></a> </div>\n<h3>Communication &amp; sharing</h3>\n<p> Un aspect ce a fost luat în considerare foarte serios de Google este sharingul, completat de socializare &amp; comunicare. În interiorul sistemului, utilizatorii și profilele din diverse grupuri sociale și contacte sunt legate între ele pentru accesibilitate mai ușoară. Printre informațiile puse la dispoziție de People &amp; Profiles se regăsesc o fotografie de profil mai mare, numere de telefon, adrese și conturi, update-uri etc. </p>\n<div align=\"center\"><a href=\"http://www.worldit.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/contact-faves-lg1.png\"><img src=\"http://www.worldit.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/contact-faves-lg1-168x300.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"Android 4.0 - Contact Favorites\" width=\"168\" height=\"300\"></a> <a href=\"http://www.worldit.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/contact-connect-lg1.png\"><img src=\"http://www.worldit.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/contact-connect-lg1-168x300.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"Android 4.0 - Contact connect\" width=\"168\" height=\"300\"></a> <a href=\"http://www.worldit.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/contact-email-lg1.png\"><img src=\"http://www.worldit.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/contact-email-lg1-168x300.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"Android 4.0 - Contact Email\" width=\"168\" height=\"300\"></a></div>\n<h4>Îmbunătățiri ale camerei</h4>\n<p> Aplicația camerei include noi facilități. Pe lângă faptul că imediat după capturare se pot împărtăși cu prietenii rapid și simplu, noua versiune a aplicației dispune de integrarea focusului continuu, imagini precise, viteza de shot-to-shot redusă permite realizarea unor capturi clare, detecția automată a fețelor umane completate de auto-focus. Mai mult, s-a integrat și un mod panoramic de tip single-motion.   </p>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.worldit.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/camera-lg1.png\"><img src=\"http://www.worldit.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/camera-lg1-300x171.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"Android 4.0 - Camera\" width=\"280\" height=\"171\"></a><a href=\"http://www.worldit.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/gallery-edit-lg1.png\"><img src=\"http://www.worldit.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/gallery-edit-lg1-300x168.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"Android 4.0 - Gallery\" width=\"280\" height=\"168\"></a><a href=\"http://www.worldit.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/gallery-share-lg1.png\"><img src=\"http://www.worldit.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/gallery-share-lg1-300x168.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"Android 4.0 - Gallery Share\" width=\"300\" height=\"168\"></a></div>\n<p> Printre noile îmbunătățiri ale galeriei se număra redesenarea acesteia, imbunatatiriea widgetului pentru albume, efecte live în transformarea videoclipurilor. De asemenea avem în sfârșit hardware snapshot integrat native de Android.  </p>\n<h3>Experiența Cloud-Connected</h3>\n<p> Încă de la început, Android a fost cloud-connected, permițând utilizatorilor să navigheze pe web și să sincronizeze fotografii, aplicații, jocuri, căsuțe de email și contacte oriunde ar fi și pe orice device Android ar s-ar afla. S-ar părea că Android 4.0 continuă seria de îmbunătățiri la acest capitol. Printre noile funcționalități ale browserului nativ se număra sincronizarea cu Google Chrome Bookmarks. A fost definită mai bine varianta de “offline reading” ce permite citirea unei pagini chiar și atunci când suntem deconectați de la internet, printr-o copie a site-ului dorit. De asemenea, viteza de randare a paginilor a fost vizibil îmbunătățit  </p>\n<h3>Inovații</h3>\n<p> Google are în sânge inovarea. Android 4.0 nu scapă de această “problemă”. Noua versiune Android vine cu trei inovații la capitolul information sharing.  așa cum reiese și din graficele de mai jos. Și sistemul de Gmail s-a bucurat de câteva îmbunătățiri la capitolul usability, dar nimic notabil. </p>\n<div align=\"center\"><a href=\"http://www.worldit.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/browser-tabs-lg1.png\"><img src=\"http://www.worldit.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/browser-tabs-lg1-168x300.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"Android 4.0 Browser Tabs\" width=\"168\" height=\"300\"></a><a href=\"http://www.worldit.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/browser-lg1.png\"><img src=\"http://www.worldit.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/browser-lg1-168x300.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"Android 4.0 Browser\" width=\"168\" height=\"300\"></a><br>\n<a href=\"http://www.worldit.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/bbench1.png\"><img src=\"http://www.worldit.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/bbench1-300x208.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"Android 4.0 Browser Benchmark\" width=\"300\" height=\"208\"></a></div>\n<h3>Inovații</h3>\n<p> Google are în sânge inovarea.

I thought it would make sense to introduce her to my psychotherapist, Eliza.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA\">ELIZA</a> was one of the first (and longest) BASIC programs I typed into my then brand-new 16K Apple II in 1979. Originally created at MIT by Joseph Weizenbaum in 1966, this pioneering natural-language-processing simulation of a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogerian_psychotherapy\">Rogerian psychotherapist</a> impressed my family and friends every bit as much as Siri does now. I was curious to see how they would get along.</p>\n<p>Here is a transcript of their first encounter.

      "content" : "<p>Today’s Chrome web browser update means you can develop, sell, download and play 3D games written in C++ right from the Chrome Web Store, without plug-in.</p><p>This is a quick walk-through on how to develop a basic 3D Native Client app. You can try out my test app from the Chrome Web Store <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pgehkhceingafmkkmbeoempaablkkeal\">here</a> or <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/bullet%20physics\">here</a>.<br> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXNJpdPY9tQ\"><img src=\"http://altdevblogaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/bullet_native_client-300x187.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"187\"></a><br> Alternatively you can visit <a href=\"http://bulletphysics.org/nacl\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://bulletphysics.org/nacl</a> but in that case you need to enable Native Client by typing <strong>about://flags</strong> in the Chrome address bar. Chrome Web Store Native Client apps don’t require flags.</p><p>Either way, make sure your Chrome About Box shows version 15 or later.</p><p>Some features of the simple test app:</p><ul><li>OpenGL ES2 3D rendering with textures</li><li>Mouse interaction</li><li>Load binary files using a file chooser</li><li>Use of middleware: Bullet Physics, libjpeg</li></ul><h4>Download the SDK</h4><p>You can download the Native Client SDK and all tutorial and build system files in a single self-contained <a href=\"https://github.com/downloads/erwincoumans/experiments/experiments_nacl_2.zip\">zip file here</a> (64 MB). It should work out-of-the-box under Windows. This tutorial also builds under Linux or Mac OSX but that is left as an exercise for the reader (or leave a comment for help).</p><h4>Setup your build system</h4><p>Just unzip the <a href=\"https://github.com/downloads/erwincoumans/experiments/experiments_nacl_2.zip\">zip file</a> (64 MB) <strong>in a folder without spaces in the name</strong> and you are all set to go under Windows.</p><p>The Native Client SDK comes with a gcc-based compiler toolchain. You need to tell your build system the location of the C compiler (CC), C++ compiler (CXX) and linker (AR). Above zip file includes make.exe and Makefiles that work under Windows out-of-the-box. There is no need to install Cygwin or MinGW. I used premake to generate the Makefiles.</p><h4>Add some salt and pepper</h4><p>An API called Pepper is used to provide hooks between Native Client and web browser services such as HTML5 and 3D. This test application was a port from a simple Win32 application. I used the Tumbler NaCl example as a starting point. The original version is located in <strong>build\\nacl\\nacl_sdk\\pepper_15\\examples\\tumbler</strong>. In order to ‘port’ it to Native Client in a web page, the following changes were made. Most of the source code is shared and portable, to make debugging easier.</p><ul><li>Program entry point: The Windows application used WinMain as a program entry point. For Native Client the entry point is the constructor of your module.</li><li>All of the OpenGL ES initialization of matrices, shaders, textures, vertex and index buffers are the same, except for creating the context.</li><li>Keyboard and mouse input. Instead of a Windows event you register for keyboard and/or mouse events and implement the event callback.</li><li>Loading files from the local file system is not possible for obvious security reasons, so there is no ‘fopen’ command. You can let the user pick a file using the browsers build-in File Chooser, load the file in memory and use Javascript to pass the file to the Native Client module. Binary files can be base64 encoded by the browser, and decoded by your Native Client code. This works well in practice. In the future you can call the File Chooser directly from NaCl C++ code.</li></ul><h4>Build the executable</h4><p>Click on <strong>build/nacl.bat</strong> and wait. Here is the content of the batch file:</p><div><div><pre style=\"font-family:monospace\">set NACL_TARGET_PLATFORM=pepper_15\nset NACL_SDK_ROOT=%CD%/nacl/nacl_sdk\n \npremake4 --with-nacl gmake\ncd nacl\n \nset AR=%NACL_SDK_ROOT%\\%NACL_TARGET_PLATFORM%\\toolchain\\win_x86_newlib\\bin\\x86_64-nacl-ar.exe\nset CC=%NACL_SDK_ROOT%\\%NACL_TARGET_PLATFORM%\\toolchain\\win_x86_newlib\\bin\\x86_64-nacl-gcc.exe\nset CXX=%NACL_SDK_ROOT%\\%NACL_TARGET_PLATFORM%\\toolchain\\win_x86_newlib\\bin\\x86_64-nacl-g++.exe\n \nset config=release32\nmake\n \nset config=release64\nmake</pre></div></div><p>This builds two Native Client executables, 32bit x86 and 64bit x64, they are located in build\\nacl\\nginx-1.1.2\\html\\NativeClientTumbler.exe and build\\nacl\\nginx-1.1.2\\html\\NativeClientTumbler_64.exe<br> The web page know how to load this module using a manifest file called <a href=\"https://github.com/erwincoumans/experiments/blob/master/build/nacl/nginx-1.1.2/html/tumbler.nmf\">tumbler.nmf</a> :</p><div><div><pre style=\"font-family:monospace\">{\n  &quot;program&quot;: {\n    &quot;x86-64&quot;: {&quot;url&quot;: &quot;NativeClientTumbler_x64.exe&quot;},\n    &quot;x86-32&quot;: {&quot;url&quot;: &quot;NativeClientTumbler.exe&quot;}\n  }\n}</pre></div></div><p>The index.html web page can load the Native Client code using this tumbler.nmf file. Check out <a href=\"https://github.com/erwincoumans/experiments/blob/master/build/nacl/nginx-1.1.2/html/index.html#L129\">index.html</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/erwincoumans/experiments/blob/master/build/nacl/nginx-1.1.2/html/tumbler.js#L128\">tumbler.js</a> for details.</p><h4>Test the application</h4><p>Click on build/nacl_runtest.bat and confirm that the nginx web browser is allowed to wait for connections.</p><p>Native Client applications hosted in the Chrome Web Store should run without special flags or settings. In order to run NaCl modules in web pages outside of the Store you need to enable Native Client manually. Just type <strong>about://flags</strong> in the Chrome address bar and enable the Native Client setting.</p><p>Now open Chrome and type <a href=\"http://localhost/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://localhost/index.html</a> and if all goes well you can play your app.</p><h4>Debug the application</h4><p>You can use ‘printf’ debugging using the Javascript console, but in most cases it is easier to maintain a Windows version and perform debugging under Visual Studio. You can compile the tutorial under Visual Studio by clicking on the build/vs2008.bat file and open the GLES2_BulletBlendReader_Angle project. This project emulates OpenGL ES2 under Windows using a DirectX wrapper called <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/angleproject\">Angle</a>.</p><h4>Deploy to the Chrome Web Store</h4><p>You can make your C++ Native Client module available for free or for sale in the Chrome Web Store. A one-time registration fee of just 5$ is used, probably to stop spam. You have to create a manifold.json that provides the information about your application. This includes the name, description and where the web page and assets are located. Here is the manifest used for this tutorial:</p><div><div><pre style=\"font-family:monospace\">{\n    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Bullet Physics NaCl Test&quot;,\n    &quot;version&quot;: &quot;0.8&quot;,\n    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;This Native Client module runs a C++ Bullet Physics simulation.&quot;,\n    &quot;app&quot;: {\n\t    &quot;launch&quot;: {\n\t       &quot;local_path&quot;: &quot;index.html&quot;\n\t    }\n\t  },\n\t  &quot;icons&quot;: {\n\t  &quot;16&quot;: &quot;bullet_icon16.png&quot;,\n      &quot;128&quot;: &quot;bullet_icon128.png&quot;\n    }\n}</pre></div></div><h4>Notes</h4><p>Most of the Google NaCl SDK relies on having Python installed, and I wanted this tutorial to work without external dependencies such as Python, Cygwin or MinGW etc. I used the following replacements:</p><ul><li>Python was used for the scons build system. I replaced scons by Makefiles, because I think Makefiles are more standard and simpler to adapt to other build systems. I used premake4 to generate the Makefiles to keep it self-contained.</li><li>Python was also used to download and update the Native Client SDK.

If I have to read it a second time,\nthe bug has already become more complex, since something prevented me from\njust fixing it the first time. If more information has to be added to the\nbug, that makes it yet more complex. If there is an argument in the bug\nabout whether it is a bug, or how to fix it, just revisiting the bug at a\nlater date can become more expensive than it's worth. Much of what is\ninvolved in filing good and effective bug reports are obvious corollaries\nof this. It also follows that it's best to either fix, or at least plan how\nto fix a bug immediatly upon reading it.</p>\n\n<p>Second thought is about \"wontfix\". A bug submitter and the developer\nresponsible for the bug see this state in very different ways, but the name\nhides what it really means, which is that there is a meta-bug affecting\neither the bug submitter, the developer, or both. Once you realize this,\nwontfix bugs, from either side, become a bit personally insulting. They\nalso quickly decay to uselessness (see first thought), and then just lurk\nthere wasting the developer's time in various ways. Bug tracking systems\nshould not provide a \"wontfix\" state; if they want to track meta-bugs\nthey should provide a way to reassign such a bug to some other party who\ncan actually resolve such a meta-bug.</p>"

En effet, le BIOS, l'élément primitif indispensable au démarrage de la machine, a été mis non pas sur les disques de boot mais en ROM, sur la carte mère.</p>\n\n<p>Quelques années plus tard, après un peu de reverse engineering, des fabricants ont pu commencer à vendre des clones PC compatibles basés sur une ré-implémentation du BIOS. Le BIOS est moche, clairement. Très basique, très crade. Mais il faisait son travail, il fournit une abstraction très primitive au matériel. On pouvait presque écrire un OS uniquement en faisant des appels au BIOS, comme DOS.</p>\n\n<p>Les appels au BIOS sont très simples : il s'agit tout bêtement d'une série d'interruptions matérielles. À travers l'IRQ 0x10, on peut donner différentes instructions à la carte graphique, via le registre AH : scroll, changer le mode, les couleurs. L'IRQ 0x13 permet de contrôler les disques.</p>\n\n<h2>Naissance d'EFI</h2>\n\n<p>Mais avec l'évolution du matériel, les limites sont apparues : le BIOS utilise un mode 16 bits, ne lui permettant pas d'adresser toute la RAM, le boot par le réseau ou par CD est apparu, l'USB est arrivé. Récemment toutefois, nous avons atteint une limite très difficile à surmonter : la table des partitions gérée par le BIOS ne permet pas d'exploiter des disques de plus de 2 To.</p>\n\n<p>En parallèle, depuis la fin des années 90, Intel avait développé, en partenariat avec HP, l'architecture Itanium, pour laquelle l'utilisation du BIOS n'était pas envisageable. Ainsi Intel développa un outil moderne, puissant, flexible, simple et unanimement repris : l'EFI.</p>\n\n<p>Bon, ok, en vrai c'est plus compliqué : en 1994, l'IEEE avait déjà standardisé Open Firmware, une solution multi plateforme et acceptée pour accomplir une tâche similaire au BIOS. Utilisé sur les machines Sun, Apple, IBM, c'est un outil qui a fait ses preuves et continue à les faire.</p>\n\n<p>Mais pour Intel, Open Firmware n'est pas acceptable. Officiellement, c'est parce que l'Open Firmware duplique l'ACPI en fournissant son propre arbre de périphériques. Mais depuis, le projet OLPC a prouvé que en fait, c'est possible. Par contre dans EFI, il y a un arbre de périphériques potentiellement différent de celui de l'ACPI (et vous êtes loin de la fin de ce journal, hein).</p>\n\n<p>EFI est décrit dans une spécification, contrairement au BIOS qui n'a jamais eu de telle documentation. 2210 pages, plus les 800 pages d'ACPI. Mangez la spécification, c'est du bon.</p>\n\n<p>Bien sûr, EFI a évolué lui aussi : la norme EFI a cessé d'évoluer et l'UEFI fut créé à partir d'EFI 1.10. UEFI est une évolution d'EFI contrôlée par le « forum UEFI » et non plus par Intel.</p>\n\n<p>En 2007, la version 2.1 d'UEFI a apporté la cryptographie, l'authentification réseau, la possibilité de construire une interface graphique. Ouais, on parle toujours de firmware.</p>\n\n<h2>Voyons un peu comment est construit un EFI</h2>\n\n<p>On a en fait trois couches dans EFI. Au cœur se trouve le PEI, Pre-EFI Initialization. Responsable de l'initialisation très bas niveau comme le contrôleur mémoire (truc super tordu mine de rien, cf. les présentations des auteurs de coreboot), il gère à la fois le tout début de l'allumage de la machine mais aussi la sortie de veille. Une fois qu'il a fait son travail, il laisse la main à la deuxième couche et disparaît.</p>\n\n<p>La deuxième couche se nomme DXE, Driver Execution Environment. C'est ce que l'on voit finalement du firmware. C'est un élément indépendant du matériel, capable de charger des pilotes et fournissant des interfaces génériques et normalisées aux applications souhaitant l'utiliser.</p>\n\n<p>Enfin, la troisième couche, les applications EFI, en majeure partie les bootloaders donc… Alors, si vous trouvez que ça ressemble à BIOS + OS + applications, difficile d'argumenter tellement ça semble exact ! Au passage, a priori, une application EFI dépend de l'architecture : elle sera x86, x86-64, ia64.</p>\n\n<h2>Concrêtement, comment identifier un EFI ?</h2>\n\n<p>Hum, c'est une bonne question. Je dispose depuis quelques jours d'un ordinateur portable Asus utilisant un magnifique UEFI. Mais par défaut, une émulation du BIOS est présente, permettant de booter un grub sans soucis. Pire encore, par défaut, le boot EFI n'est même pas activé sur les clés USB par exemple.</p>\n\n<p>J'avoue ne pas avoir trouvé de solution depuis Linux pour le savoir. À vrai dire, c'est le but de l'émulation du BIOS, non ? Et le Windows n'a pas vécu assez longtemps (0 secondes) pour vérifier.</p>\n\n<p>Seul un passage par l'interface de configuration du firmware (ce que, par abus de langage, on appelait BIOS) prouve que l'on est face à une machine EFI. Heureusement, ici, pas d'interface graphique qui bouge dans tous les sens. Nous avons une interface sobre, classique, contrôlée au clavier, avec des options comme « UEFI Boot » pour nous mettre sur la voie.</p>\n\n<h2>Bootons en EFI</h2>\n\n<p>Dans mon ignorance, j'ai installé ma Debian classiquement, sans réfléchir : 256 Mo pour un /boot en ext3, le reste en PV LVM, un grub, et ça roule ! Et je ne peux donc pas profiter d'un boot EFI : le bootloader pour EFI doit être stocké sur une partition pour laquelle un pilote est chargé. Ne pouvant ajouter de pilote ext3 dans mon firmware, je me vois contraint d'avoir une partition FAT pour le bootloader !</p>\n\n<p>Mon premier objectif n'étant pas la destruction de mon amour propre et de ma distribution, j'opte donc pour une solution plus sage : booter en EFI sur une clé USB. Le boot EFI 100% natif top moumoute viendra plus tard.</p>\n\n<p>Préparons donc une clé USB à booter en EFI. Mais que mettre dessus ? Mettre un grub classique pour un BIOS, je sais faire. Mais un EFI ne mange pas de ce pain.</p>\n\n<p>Ma clé USB était une clé USB classique, partitionnée avec une table de partitions DOS et une seule partition FAT32, je décidais, pour l'expérience, de la maltraiter un peu. Mais normalement, vous n'avez pas à la maltraiter à ce point.</p>\n\n<p>Donc maltraitons-la : passons-la en GPT, nouveau format de table de partitions, permettant de passer outre la limite des 2 To (indispensable sur une clé de 8 Go). Pour ce faire, parted est notre ami avec la commande mklabel gpt (ce journal ne visant pas à faire de vous un expert de parted, je n'irai pas plus loin).</p>\n\n<p>Il suffit donc d'avoir une table des partitions valide, comprise du BIOS, et d'y glisser subtilement une partition FAT. Faisons donc. Mais que mettre sur cette partition FAT, et où ? C'est là où j'ai perdu le plus de temps finalement.</p>\n\n<p>J'avais expliqué tantôt que l'EFI charge une application, la plupart du temps un bootloader. Mais je ne suis pas fou, je vais pas directement tenter grub. Tentons plus simple, plus utile aussi pour une clé USB : l'EFI shell (explications dans un paragraphe, j'ai pas trouvé mieux comme organisation).</p>\n\n<p>Le projet tiano-core, une implémentation libre du cœur d'UEFI, nous fournit ce shell à l'adresse suivante :<br><a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/tianocore/index.php?title=UEFI_Shell\">http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/tianocore/index.php?title=UEFI_Shell</a></p>\n\n<p>Mettons ce shell sur la clé USB. Pour cela, je crée un dossier EFI, et je mets dedans le fichier shell.efi. Mais ça ne marche pas (n'essayez pas).</p>\n\n<p>En effet, il faut mettre un bon nom au fichier. Le fichier de boot, dans le cas d'une clé USB en x86-64, doit être à l'emplacement suivant :<br>\n\\EFI\\boot\\bootx64.efi</p>\n\n<p>Notez l'utilisation de la notation x64 pour parler d'x86-64, que l'on nomme amd64. x64 est la notation de Sun et Microsoft. Et l'anti-slash est de mise en EFI.</p>\n\n<p>Une fois le fichier mis sur la clé, et la machine bootée, on se retrouve dans le grandiose EFI shell !</p>\n\n<h2>Le shell EFI</h2>\n\n<p>Le premier qui dit que ça ressemble à DOS gagne un cadeau Bonux. Notons tout d'abord la liste des périphériques blocs détectés, affichée en haut de l'écran au lancement du Un conseil : ajoutez immédiatement ce logiciel dans votre trousse à outils pour dépanner des machines. Je ne plaisante pas : il me semble être tout simplement indispensable, pour les futurs EFI buggés, de disposer de cet outil et des quelques utilitaires qu'il propose.</p>\n\n<p>Vous voici maintenant devant un shell à l'invite fort engageante, couleur jaune sur un fond noir :<br><code>text <br>\n Shell&gt; <br></code> </p>\n\n<p>shell. Sur mon PC portable, j'en ai 8 :<br>\n- fs0 alias hd22b0d0b (après plusieurs reboot : cet identifiant est dynamique) alias blk0<br>\n    Chemin complet :<br>\n      Acpi(PNP0A03,0)/Pci(1D|0)/Usb(1,0)/Usb(3,0)/HD(Part1,Sig64ED66EC-D248-412A-AEEB-B0ECA830E264)<br>\n- blk1<br>\n    Chemin complet :<br>\n      Acpi(PNP0A03,0)/Pci(1F|2)/Sata(0,0)/HD(Part1,Sig0003AC8C)<br>\n- blk2<br>\n    Chemin complet :<br>\n      Acpi(PNP0A03,0)/Pci(1F|2)/Sata(0,0)/HD(Part2,Sig0003AC8C)<br>\n- blk3<br>\n    Chemin complet :<br>\n      Acpi(PNP0A03,0)/Pci(1F|2)/Sata(0,0)<br>\n- blk4<br>\n    Chemin complet :<br>\n      Acpi(PNP0A03,0)/Pci(1F|2)/Sata(2,0)<br>\n- blk5<br>\n    Chemin complet :<br>\n      Acpi(PNP0A03,0)/Pci(1D|0)/Usb(1,0)/Usb(3,0)Ok, facile de deviner : fs0 est la partition 1 de clé USB. Mais que faire d'autre maintenant ?</p>\n\n<p>Je ne m'amuserai plus à recopier tout le résultat des commandes, voici les commandes qui m'ont semblé intéressantes :</p>\n\n<ul><li>help : l'indispensable</li>\n<li>drivers : liste l'ensemble des pilotes chargés dans l'UEFI. Comme ça, quand votre clé USB 4 ne fonctionnera pas, vous pourrez charger un pilote USE 4 depuis votre clé USB 3</li>\n<li>devices : liste les périphériques connus, mais c'est moins joli que devtree</li>\n</ul><p>Mouais… Pas super fun. Au passage, vous verrez des commandes pour le support de DHCP, d'IPv4. Rien pour IPv6 par contre. Ça c'est l'avenir.</p>\n\n<p>Explorons donc plutôt le système de fichiers. Vous vous souvenez bien de DOS ? Si oui, c'est facile :<br>\nfs0:</p>\n\n<p>Et voilà, vous êtes dans le disque fs0… Puis vous pouvez utiliser les bonnes vieilles commandes DOS type cd, dir (ou ls, ouf !), type (et pas cat)…</p>\n\n<p>Mais passons à plus rigolo : bootons un Linux depuis EFI !</p>\n\n<h2>efilinux</h2>\n\n<p>efilinux est une solution très récente et très simple pour booter un linux depuis EFI. C'est le lilo d'EFI, en quelque sorte. Il est disponible en paquet Debian, et contient principalement le fichier suivant : /usr/lib/efilinux/efilinux.efi</p>\n\n<p>On va donc mettre efilinux.efi sur la clé USB et l'accompagner d'un vmlinuz et de l'initrd correspondant.</p>\n\n<p>On se retrouve donc avec dans fs0:/EFI les fichiers suivants :</p>\n\n<ul><li>boot\\bootx64.efi : le shell</li>\n<li>vmlinuz-3.1.0-rc7-amd64</li>\n<li>initrd-3.1.0-rc7-amd64</li>\n<li>efilinux.efi</li>\n</ul><p>La méthode de boot est très très simple :</p>\n\n<p>fs0:<br>\ncd EFI<br>\nefilinux.efi -f 0:\\EFI\\vmlinuz-3.1.0-rc7-amd64 root=/dev/mapper/asus--laptop-root ro initrd=0:\\EFI\\initrd-3.1.0-rc7-amd64</p>\n\n<p>Et voilà !<br>\nVous avez booté votre premier noyau avec un système EFI « pur ».<br>\nEt vous verrez la différence :<br>\ndmesg | grep -c -i efi</p>\n\n<p>=&gt; 308<br>\nContre 0 ou 1 auparavant…</p>\n\n<p>Devant la longueur de ce journal, il est urgent d'attendre avant de continuer. Prochain épisode : je remplace grub par un bootloader UEFI… Puis je code une appli UEFI !</p>\n\n<h2>Remerciements</h2>\n\n<p>Merci à Asus de rembourser Windows sans me priver de ma machine...<br>\nMerci à Matthew Garrett pour son magnifique blog et ses grandes explications sur EFI...<br>\nEt merci à Debian pour exister...</p>\n\n<p>P.S. : je ne peux garantir que tout ceci fonctionne sur une machine Apple, tout simplement parce qu'elles utilisent une solution bâtarde entre EFI et UEFI, avec un comportement souvent différent de ce que l'on voit sur les machines des autres constructeurs.</p></div>"

There are now under threat, please see below for details and spread the word.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>On October 15, a group of nearly 300 activists began an occupation of São Paulo in the Valley of Anhagabau, one of the sites of the first rallies for direct elections during the end of the Brazilian military dictatorship in the 1980s.  After a week of peaceful encampment, educational and cultural programs, and creating a sustainable community for not just themselves but many homeless people in downtown São Paulo, the Occupy São Paulo movement is coming under increased police threat.  Today, Monday October 24, the governor of the state of São Paulo, Geraldo Alckmin is holding two special events.  First, he is hosting Florida Governor Rick Scott (R).  Second, Alckmin has decided to hold a parade of 3000 military police right next to the encampment (see photo above). </p>\n<p>After a week of police harrassment and a pending court case for them to hold the right to pitch their tents, the Occupy São Paulo movement sees this as an escalation of the harassment they have already faced by city police.  Further, the presence of 3000 military police next to 300 occupiers is clearly meant to intimidate both occupiers and members of the public who have been coming up to the encampment and learning about the movement.   Please take the time to call or email the governor and the secretary of public security of the state of São Paulo to condemn this action.  You can also send messages of solidarity to the São Paulo occupation at occupysampaenglish@googlegroups.com.</p>\n<p>To contact Governor Geraldo Alckmin’s office of citizen and organizational relations:</p>\n<p>Fill out a comment form at:  http://www.saopaulo.sp.gov.br/en/fale/fale.php<br>\nPhone: 55-11-2193-8463</p>\n<p>To contact the Secretary of Public Security, Antônio Ferreiro Pinto:<br>\nEmail: seguranca@sp.gov.br<br>\nPhone: 55-11-3291-8500</p>"

The government plans to spend $100,000,000 of federal money and $50,000,000 of Victorian state money to build a new coal power station. The state government has imposed some unreasonable restrictions on renewable energy which includes allowing a single person who objects within 2Km of a wind turbine to block the project while also not allowing anyone to object to coal power plants or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracking\">fracking</a> (both of which have proven health implications). Today VCAT had a hearing about this issue, HRL wants to double the size of the proposed coal power plant while Environment Victoria, Doctors for the Environment Australia, local climate action group Locals Into Victoria’s Environment Martin Shield from Climate Action Moreland are opposing the plan.</p>\n<p>What the government should be doing is permitting (if not encouraging) renewable energy production, particularly wind power which will drive down energy prices by undercutting the energy auctions due to it’s almost zero marginal cost. The government should not be spending tax payer money on new coal projects due to climate change and air pollution – in addition to the fact that coal is simply more expensive in the long term.</p>\n<p>As usual it’s disappointing that the National party which supposedly represents farmers is supporting the government in such things. The pollution caused by coal power and fracking ends up damaging farmland. The Liberal party doesn’t have a majority on it’s own in either house of the state government, so this proposed coal power plant could be stopped immediately if the National party supported renewable power, or even if they merely opposed giving $50,000,000 of state tax money to HRL.</p>\n<p>The demonstration went reasonably well, there was about 80 people there when I arrived and by the time it ended there were more than 150 people. I took the above picture at the start and it missed many people who were off to the right. I think that’s a good result for a demonstration that had little publicity and was held in business hours with really bad weather.</p>\n<p><b>Update:</b></p>\n<p>On Sunday the 13th of November at 13:00-14:30 there is a “<b>Going Backwards Under Baillieu</b>” demonstration at Parliament House. This is to mark the negative affects that the Liberal state government has had on the environment of Victoria.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>[1]<a href=\"http://www.stophrl.org/\"> http://www.stophrl.org/</a></li>\n</ul>"

      "content" : "<img src=\"http://planet.debian.org/heads/cjwatson.png\" width=\"70\" height=\"82\" alt=\"\" align=\"right\" style=\"float:right\">  <p>As is natural for an LTS cycle, lots of people are thinking and talking about work focused on quality rather than features.  With Canonical <a href=\"http://www.canonical.com/content/ubuntu-1204-feature-extended-support-period-desktop-users\">extending LTS support</a> to five years on the desktop for 12.04, much of this is quite rightly focused on the desktop.  I'm really not a desktop hacker in any way, shape, or form, though.  I spent my first few years in Ubuntu working mainly on the installer - I still do, although I do some other things now too - and I used to say only half-jokingly that my job was done once X started.  Of course there are plenty of bugs I can fix, but I wanted to see if I could do something with a bit more structure, so I got to thinking about projects we could work on at the foundations level that would make a big difference.</p>\n\n<h2>Image build pipeline</h2>\n\n<p>One difficulty we have is that quite a few of our bugs - especially installer bugs, although this goes for some other things too - are only really caught when people are doing coordinated image testing just before a milestone release.  Now, it takes a while to do all the builds and then it takes a while to test them.  The excellent work of the QA team has meant that testing is much quicker now than it used to be, and a certain amount of smoke-testing is automated (particularly for server images).  On the other hand, the build phase has only got longer as we've added more flavours and architectures, particularly as some parts of the process are still serialised per architecture or subarchitecture so ARM builds in particular take a very long time indeed.  Exact timings are a bit difficult to get for various reasons, but I think the minimum time between a developer uploading a fix and us having a full set of candidate images on all architectures including that fix is currently somewhere north of eight hours, and that's with people cutting corners and pulling strings which is a suboptimal thing to have to do around release time.  This obviously makes us reluctant to respin for anything short of showstopper bugs.  If we could get things down to something closer to two hours, respins would be a much less horrible proposition and so we might be able to fix a few bugs that are serious but not showstoppers, not to mention that the release team would feel less burned out.</p>\n\n<p>We discussed this problem at the release sprint, and came up with a <a href=\"https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/foundations-p-image-build-pipeline\">laundry list of improvements</a>; I've scheduled this for discussion at UDS in case we can think of any more.  Please come along if you're interested!</p>\n\n<p>One thing in particular that I'm working on is refactoring <a href=\"https://launchpad.net/germinate\">Germinate</a>, a tool which dates right back to our first meeting before Ubuntu was even called Ubuntu and whose job is to expand dependencies starting from our lists of \"seed\" packages; we use this, among other things, to generate <code>Task</code> fields in the archive and to decide which packages to copy into our images.  This was acceptably quick in 2004, but now that we run it forty times (eight flavours multiplied by five architectures) at the end of every publisher run it's actually become rather a serious performance problem: <code>cron.germinate</code> takes about ten minutes, which is over a third of the typical publisher runtime.  It parses Packages files eight times as often as it needs to, Sources files forty times as often as it needs to, and recalculates the dependency tree of the base system five times as often as it needs to.  I am confident that we can significantly reduce the runtime here, and I think there's some hope that we might be able to move the publisher back to a 30-minute cycle, which would increase the velocity of Ubuntu development in general.</p>\n\n<h2>Maintaining the development release</h2>\n\n<p>Our release cycle always starts with syncing and merging packages from Debian unstable (or testing in the case of LTS cycles).  The vast majority of packages in Ubuntu arrive this way, and generally speaking if we didn't do this we would fall behind in ways that would be difficult to recover from later.  However, this does mean that we get a \"big bang\" of changes at the start of the cycle, and it takes a while for the archive to be usable again.  Furthermore, even once we've taken care of this, we have a long-established rhythm where the first part of the cycle is mainly about feature development and the second part of the cycle is mainly about stabilisation.  As a result, we've got used to the archive being fairly broken for the first few months, and we even tell people that they shouldn't expect things to work reliably until somewhere approaching beta.</p>\n\n<p>This makes some kind of sense from the inside.  But how are you supposed to do feature development that relies on other things in the development release?</p>\n\n<p>In the first few years of Ubuntu, this question didn't matter very much.  Nearly all the people doing serious feature development were themselves serious Ubuntu developers; they were capable of fixing problems in the development release as they went along, and while it got in their way a little bit it wasn't all that big a deal.  Now, though, we have people focusing on things like Unity development, and we shouldn't assume that just because somebody is (say) an OpenGL expert or a window management expert that they should be able to recover from arbitrary failures in development release upgrades.  One of the best things we could do to help the 12.04 desktop be more stable is to have the entire system be less unstable as we go along, so that developers further up the stack don't have to be distracted by things wobbling underneath them.  Plus, it's just good software engineering to keep the basics working as you go along: it should always build, it should always install, it should always upgrade.  Ubuntu is too big to do something like having everyone stop any time the build breaks, the way you might do in a smaller project, but we shouldn't let things slide for months either.</p>\n\n<p>I've been talking to <a href=\"http://theravingrick.blogspot.com/\">Rick Spencer</a> and the other Ubuntu engineering leads at Canonical about this.  Canonical has a system of \"rotations\", where you can go off to another team for a while if you're in need of a change or want to branch out a bit; so I proposed that we allow our engineers to spend a month or two at a time on what I'm calling the <strong>+1 Maintenance Team</strong>, whose job is simply to keep the development release buildable, installable, and upgradeable at all times.  Rick has been very receptive to this, and we're going to be running this as a trial throughout the 12.04 cycle, with probably about three people at a time.  As well as being professional archive gardeners, these people will also work on developing infrastructure to help us keep better track of what we need to do.  For instance, we could deploy better tools from Debian QA to help us track uninstallable packages, or we could enhance <a href=\"http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/nbs.html\">some</a> of our <a href=\"http://conflictchecker.ubuntu.com/possible-conflicts/oneiric/main.txt\">many</a> <a href=\"http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches.txt\">existing</a> <a href=\"http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/testing/precise_probs.html\">reports</a> to have bug links and/or comment facilities, or we could spruce up the <a href=\"http://reports.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/ogasawara/weatherreport.html\">weather report</a>; there are lots of things we could do to make our own lives easier.</p>\n\n<p>By 12.04, I would like, in no particular order:</p>\n\n<ul>\n <li>Precise to have been more or less continuously usable from Alpha 1 onward for people with reasonable general technical ability</li>\n <li>Canonical engineering teams outside Ubuntu (DX, Ubuntu One, Launchpad, etc.) to be comfortable with running the development release on at least one system from Alpha 2 onward</li>\n <li>Installability problems in daily image builds to be dealt with within one working day, or preferably before they even make it to daily builds</li>\n <li>The archive to be close to consistent as we start milestone preparation, rather than the release team having to scramble to make it so</li>\n <li>A very significant reduction in our long-term backlog of automatically-detected problems</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Of course, this overlaps to a certain extent with the kinds of things that the MOTU team have been doing for years, not to mention with what all developers should be doing to keep their own houses in reasonable order, and I'd like us to work together on this; we're trying to provide some extra hands here to make Ubuntu better for everyone, not take over!  I would love this to be an opportunity to re-energise MOTU and bring some new people on board.</p>\n\n<p>I've registered a couple of blueprints (<a href=\"https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/other-p-plusonemaint-priorities\">priorities</a>, <a href=\"https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/other-p-plusonemaint-infrastructure\">infrastructure</a>) for discussion at UDS.  These are deliberately open-ended skeleton sessions, and I'll try to make sure they're scheduled fairly early in the week, so that we have time for break-out sessions later on.  If you're interested, please come along and give your feedback!</p>"

It’s been going for a week and yesterday <a href=\"http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/doyle-accused-of-heavyhandedness-in-halting-occupation-20111021-1mck9.html\">Robert Doyle (the Mayor of Melbourne) ordered police to disperse the protest, so riot police and mounted police forced the protesters out of the city square [4]</a>. According to the news reports there were only 100 people there at the time, <a href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=-37.815894,144.967036&amp;ll=-37.815958,144.967519&amp;spn=0.001049,0.002143&amp;sll=-37.816033,144.96649&amp;sspn=0.017629,0.032015&amp;num=1&amp;t=h&amp;vpsrc=6&amp;z=20\">here is a Google Maps link to the location, as you can see 100 people would not take up much of that space, not even with banners etc</a>. The smart move would have been for the government to ignore it all until the protesters got bored.</p>\n<p>Now of course we will have more and bigger protests. The use of riot police will probably be considered as a good thing by some of the more aggressive protesters, but anyone who doesn’t want to make the government (and the corporations that control it) look bad would consider it a gross error. Robert Doyle needs to be replaced, the liberal reason for replacing him is that we just don’t want unnecessary force used against peaceful protesters. The “conservative” reason for replacing him is that he’s grossly incompetent, he transformed a small protest that wasn’t getting much media attention and appeared to be losing interest into a large protest with a lot of media attention.</p>\n<p>It will be interesting to see what happens next.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>[1]<a href=\"http://occupywallst.org/\"> http://occupywallst.org/</a></li>\n<li>[2]<a href=\"http://www.care2.com/causes/u-s-marines-protect-occupy-wall-street-protesters-video.html\"> http://www.care2.com/causes/u-s-marines-protect-occupy-wall-street-protesters-video.html</a></li>\n<li>[3]<a href=\"http://www.occupytogether.org/\"> http://www.occupytogether.org/</a></li>\n<li>[4]<a href=\"http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/doyle-accused-of-heavyhandedness-in-halting-occupation-20111021-1mck9.html\"> http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/doyle-accused-of-heavyhandedness-in-halting-occupation-20111021-1mck9.html</a></li>\n</ul>"

      "content" : "Recentemente eu divulguei em meu twitter que estava fazendo sete anos do meu primeiro commit no projeto Firebird. Daí citaram isso no FirebirdNews e em newsletter da Firebase.<br><br>Estou dizendo isso porque apareceram algumas pessoas com aquele tipo comum de questionamento \"Como entrar para o time Firebird?\". O problema é que, como citado na newsletter da Firebase, desses sete anos pra cá nenhum desenvolvedor se juntou ao Firebird (core). Isso mesmo, com exceção de um ou outro patch específico (geralmente dos mantenedores das distros Linux), o Firebird é desenvolvido pelas mesmas poucas pessoas há mais de sete anos.<br><br>Sempre respondi esses e-mails, mas geralmente a \"vontade\" da pessoa já termina aí. E olha que sempre respondi com mais educação do que estou usando pra escrever esse post.<br><br>Então vou colocar o que realmente penso sobre isso. Em primeiro lugar, você não deve fazer essa pergunta &quot;Como entrar para o time Firebird?&quot;. A primeira coisa é aprender a usar o Google e se surgir alguma dúvida que não tenha uma resposta, aí sim pergunte sobre ela.<br><br>É normal que você tenha dificuldade pra \"se inserir\" no projeto. Eu comecei a acompanhar o desenvolvimento do Firebird em dezembro de 2003 e meu primeiro commit foi em setembro de 2004, apesar de estar trabalhando ativamente desde junho ou julho. O Claudio Valderrama costumava dizer que eu era o único que tinha aprendido o código em algumas semanas, mas como podem ver foi alguns meses :), sem falar que até hoje eu não gosto nem de ver certos subsistemas (hello PAG, CCH, SDW...).<br><br>Outra coisa são suas habilidades. Não é normal que você não tenha no mínimo bons conhecimentos sobre C++, que é a linguagem usada no desenvolvimento do Firebird. Eu posso te afirmar com 98% de certeza que você não vai encontrar em um projeto open-source pessoas com vontade de te ajudar com coisas básicas.<br><br>Digamos que você já esteja pensando que não quer isso (como todos os anteriores), mas tenha alguma dúvida ainda, então continuo minhas sugestões para que você não consiga :). Não leia todos os posts das listas de discussões. Também não leia e tente entender todas as alterações feitas no código, que são enviadas pra lista firebird-checkins. Acho que foi aqui que falhei, pois desde aquele dezembro de 2003 não deixei de ler nenhuma das milhares de mensagens. E tenho certeza que todos os outros desenvolvedores ativos fizeram e fazem o mesmo.<br><br>Se você também se ofendeu com esse post (caso tenha sido um dos que fez aquela pergunta), é melhor não perder seu tempo e desistir logo. Quem acompanha as listas firebird-devel e firebird-architect (e a firebird-admins, mas essa é fechada), sabe do que estou falando. As vezes (pra não dizer, muitas vezes) as discussões partem pro lado pessoal, e isso é a pior parte de fazer parte do projeto. Isso não é uma exclusividade do Firebird. Comparando com o Linux, por exemplo, é só procurar alguma mensagem do Linus Torvals na lkml e ver como a coisa geralmente funciona."

      "content" : "<p>Here is the summary of the text below: Thread pools are superior. Which is hardly surprising, but now I have numbers to back it up. You can download the benchmark code I wrote <a href=\"http://fioniasoftware.dk/freebies.html\">from my website</a>.</p>\n<p>The last couple of months have been spent with heavily multithreaded Qt code. Fun, yes, but also challenging. I have always had three rules about multithreading: 1: Don’t do it! 2: Don’t do it! 3: Don’t do it yet. Threaded code is harder to build and debug, and with event driven applications you rarely need to use it.</p>\n<p>But in some cases multithreading is necessary. One example was my last customer. They had an application that had threads talking to hardware. This is a perfectly good example of something that certainly fits well in a separate thread.</p>\n<p>When the hardware did something, they generated a work request. This was a QThread subclass that they called start on, and let it do it’s thing, and deleted the thread on completion. Not an unreasonable approach, but as they were generating around 10 threads per second, I did not like it. This is a textbook example of what QThreadPool is for.</p>\n<p>I made a change on some of the work requests so they used QThreadPool instead. The modification to the code is minimal. Instead of subclassing QThread, they should subclass QRunnable. And then QThreadPool should run and delete the thread instead of the thread itself handling that.</p>\n<p>First results were surprising: The work request time increased instead of going down. I told them not to worry, because the time of an individual request is not really what is interesting, the effect on the whole system is more important. In some use cases this is not true, but the new work request time handling was still well within their requirements.</p>\n<p>So, the question remains whether I was right or not. Will a thread pool implementation use less total cpu time than a QThread based implementation? To answer this question, I wrote a small test benchmark. The code is very simple, but it does produce a pretty heavy load when run. As mentioned above, you can download it <a href=\"http://fioniasoftware.dk/freebies.html\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Each work request makes a list of 1000 integers and then sorts them. Simple piece of work, and not something the compiler can do any tricks on. This simple function is just called by my QThread and QRunnable subclasses in the <code>run()</code> method.</p>\n<pre>\nstatic QList&lt;int&gt; doWork() {\n    QList&lt;int&gt; numbers;\n\n    // Fill the list with some numbers\n    const int numberSize = 1000;\n    int currentNumber = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; numberSize; ++i) {\n        currentNumber = (currentNumber + 367) &amp; 1023;\n        numbers &lt;&lt; currentNumber;\n    }\n\n    qSort(numbers);\n    return numbers;\n}\n</pre>\n<p>The tests do a number of iterations and on each iteration creates a number of threads and then goes to sleep for a bit, giving the worker threads some time for their work. With the numbers below, all was run with creating 25 worker threads on each iteration and sleeping for 10ms between each iteration. At the end, the QThread implementation deletes all the thread instances because QThreadPool does this automatically.</p>\n<p>This is the loop that creates the worker threads and executes them. After this code, it deletes the threads and waits for all of them to finish.</p>\n<pre>\nvoid ThreadStarter::run() {\n    QList&lt;QThread*&gt; threads;\n    threads.reserve(mIterations * mThreadsPerIteration);\n\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; mIterations; ++i) {\n        for (int t = 0; t &lt; mThreadsPerIteration; ++t) {\n            if (mType == Thread) {\n                WorkThread* thread = new WorkThread;\n                thread-&gt;start();\n                threads &lt;&lt; thread;\n            } else {\n                WorkRunnable* runnable = new WorkRunnable;\n                QThreadPool::globalInstance()-&gt;start(runnable);\n\n                // Mimic the same work as with threads\n                threads &lt;&lt; 0;\n            }\n        }\n\n        msleep(mSleepTime);\n    }\n    ...\n</pre>\n<p>I ran this with a growing number of iterations. The table below shows the number of iterations, the time for the thread based implementation to run, and finally the time for the threadpool implementation:</p>\n<pre>\ni: 10 thread ms: 107 runnable ms: 102\ni: 20 thread ms: 215 runnable ms: 206\ni: 30 thread ms: 322 runnable ms: 311\ni: 40 thread ms: 429 runnable ms: 407\ni: 50 thread ms: 546 runnable ms: 507\ni: 60 thread ms: 651 runnable ms: 610\ni: 70 thread ms: 765 runnable ms: 713\ni: 80 thread ms: 860 runnable ms: 812\ni: 90 thread ms: 966 runnable ms: 912\ni: 100 thread ms: 1084 runnable ms: 1022\ni: 110 thread ms: 1181 runnable ms: 1119\ni: 120 thread ms: 1289 runnable ms: 1218\ni: 130 thread ms: 1404 runnable ms: 1318\ni: 140 thread ms: 1505 runnable ms: 1420\ni: 150 thread ms: 1624 runnable ms: 1521\ni: 160 thread ms: 1722 runnable ms: 1622\ni: 170 thread ms: 1842 runnable ms: 1728\ni: 180 thread ms: 1944 runnable ms: 1823\ni: 190 thread ms: 2043 runnable ms: 1924\n</pre>\n<p>As you can see, the conclusion is completely clear: In every case, the thread pool implementation is faster than the QThread implementation. So even though each worker thread could finish faster with the thread implementation, the total system time is higher. This is relevant when the machine gets heavily loaded (as it did for my customer), because then you need the threads to take up as little total time as possible.</p>\n<p>I have run this with other numbers of threads generated and sleeping time, and on different machines. The conclusion have always been the same. Not a single time has the QThread approach been the fastest.</p>\n<p>There is another benefit to the thread pool based approach that has nothing to do with speed. This is the problem of deletion of the worker threads. It’s not trivial to figure out how to delete the thread object, once it’s done. Of course, a connect from <code>finished()</code> to <code>deleteLater()</code> usually does the trick. Unless you do something like <code>thread-&gt;moveToThread(thread)</code> and call <code>exec()</code> in the run method. With the thread pool approach it’s trivial, since the pool will by default just delete the worker thread object when it’s done.</p>\n<p>So, my recommendation stands: Unless you have a really good reason not to, you should use a thread pool for worker threads.</p>"

If it finds the counterpart you have to option to apply a quick fix (denoted by a little light bulb and invokable also with the Alt+Return shortcut) that will make the counterpart match the changes you did to the method.<br>\nTogether with the improvements to the “insert definition from declaration” quick fix (it will now minimize the names by e.g. throwing away unnecessary namespaces, and find a much more suitable spot in the code), this is a real productivity boost when writing C++ code.</p>\n<p><div>\n\t<a href=\"http://labs.qt.nokia.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/semantichighlight.png\"><img src=\"http://labs.qt.nokia.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/semantichighlight.png\" alt=\"Semantic highlighting in QML\" title=\"Semantic highlighting in QML\" width=\"327\" height=\"270\"></a>\n\t<p>Semantic highlighting in QML</p>\n</div><br>\nThe QML editor also got lots of news, so for example a real “Rename usages” functionality and semantic highlighting. Additionally the coding style options, both for C++ and QML got redesigned to be saved as “schemes”, so it is easy now to re-use coding style settings in different projects, and also to share them. You can read more about these editor improvements in <a href=\"http://labs.qt.nokia.com/2011/09/28/qt-creator-editor-news/\">Christian’s blog post</a>.</p>\n<p>I’ll just mention a few of the other things before pointing you to the actual download links and urging you to try it out for yourself:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There have been lots of QML debugging bugs fixed, especially for mixed QML/C++ debugging</li>\n<li>Even the preferences dialog should fit nicely onto a netbook now <img src=\"http://labs.qt.nokia.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\";)\"> </li>\n<li>The “advanced search” got a UI overhaul and you can access your most recent searches now</li>\n<li>Much more!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Finally, a few words of advice:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you don’t find the Qt Versions settings, they, the Tool Chains and Projects settings have been merged into a single category “Build &amp; Run”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The packages are as usual on our developer.qt.nokia.com <a href=\"http://developer.qt.nokia.com/wiki/Qt_Creator_Releases\">Qt Creator downloads</a> page.</p>"

Starting today, development of Qt will be governed as a true open source project.</p>\n<p>We now have <a href=\"http://qt-project.org\">qt-project.org</a> – a website where all development of Qt will be centered, providing the same infrastructure and processes for everybody that wants to contribute to Qt.</p>\n<h2>Now that we are here, what next?</h2>\n<p>If you are interested in participating and becoming part of the Qt Project community, the first place to look is at the projects website at <a href=\"http://qt-project.org\">qt-project.org</a>. This page gives a good overview on how to get started, and how you can become part of the community and contribute to Qt.</p>\n<p>If you have already been working with Qt, you most likely have an account in <a href=\"https://bugreports.qt.nokia.com\">Jira</a>, our bugtracking tool. This account is required to get access to the central place where all development happens: <a href=\"http://codereview.qt-project.org\">codereview.qt-project.org</a>.</p>\n<p>Our Gerrit server at <a href=\"http://codereview.qt-project.org\">codereview.qt-project.org</a> will function as the central place where patches get pushed to, and there the patches are then reviewed and tested. Everybody that has a Jira account can push patches to codereview as a Contributor.</p>\n<p>Patches can be reviewed by anyone, and finally accepted or rejected by Approvers and <a href=\"http://developer.qt.nokia.com/wiki/Maintainers\">Maintainers</a>. You will also notice that we already have some non Nokians as Approvers and Maintainers. I’d like to especially mention that Thiago, the maintainer for QtCore (the one library everybody is using), is not working for Nokia. This is the most tangible evidence of what open governance means. I expect and hope to see even more non Nokians becoming Approvers and Maintainers in the future.</p>\n<p>For details on how to contribute, please head over to <a href=\"http://www.qt-project.org\">www.qt-project.org</a>.</p>\n<p>For now we have only a few mailing lists available at <a href=\"http://lists.qt-project.org\">lists.qt-project.org</a>, but I expect this to change and to see more specialized lists as we move forward. The most important list is the general development mailing list <a href=\"http://lists.qt-project.org/mailman/listinfo/development\">development@qt-project.org</a>. Note that the development mailing list is also a member of the <a href=\"http://lists.qt-project.org/mailman/listinfo/announce\">announcement mailing list</a>, so you will automatically get those as well.</p>\n<p>We are continuing to use Jira for tracking bugs and requirements. The current installation at <a href=\"http://bugreports.qt.nokia.com\">bugreports.qt.nokia.com</a> will be moved over the next few weeks to the Qt Project as well.</p>\n<h2>True openness</h2>\n<p>The Qt project is a true open source project. We are inviting everybody to participate and help making Qt a better product.</p>\n<p>All development will happen in one central location, with access for everyone at the same time. No more separate code flow for “Nokians vs others”, and no more time delays! What you see is what we see. Discussions, decisions and roadmapping will all happen in the community, by the community, for the community. Anyone can be a Contributor, and even an Approver or Maintainer if they show enough merit.</p>\n<h2>Talk with us about Open Governance at Qt Developer Days</h2>\n<p>Sessions regarding the Qt Project and open governance will be happening at Qt Developer Days, and I’ll also be talking about it during my keynote. If you are coming to the event, you will have an opportunity to learn more and get involved in the discussion. If you are considering coming to Dev Days, this discussion is one of many good reasons to get yourself there!</p>\n<h2>Conclusions and thanks</h2>\n<p>I am extremely happy to see that this move has now finally happened. I’d like to take the opportunity to thank all the people that have helped making this happen. There are many people that have contributed, but a few should be specifically mentioned : Thiago Macieira for driving the initial work on open governance, Marius Storm-Olsen for taking over much of that work, Cristy Hamley for handling all of the legal issues, and Olivia Puntanen for managing the project. Thank you all.</p>\n<p>I am very much looking forward to starting a new chapter in the development of Qt, and excited to work with all of you towards making Qt an even better product.</p>"

While it represents the outcome of multiple discussions on the topic with a variety of people, nothing written below should be construed as Red Hat's corporate position</i><br><br>The FSF have <a href=\"http://www.fsf.org/campaigns/secure-boot-vs-restricted-boot\">released a statement</a> on UEFI secure boot. It explains the fundamental issue here, which isn't something as simple as \"will OEMs let me install Linux\". It's \"Does the end user have the ability to manage their own keys\".<br><br>Secure boot is a valuable feature. It does neatly deal with the growing threat of pre-OS malware. There is an incentive for it to be supported under Linux. I discussed the technical aspects of implementing support for it <a href=\"http://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/6054.html\">here</a> - it's not a huge deal of work, and it is being worked on. So let's not worry about that side of things. The problem is with the keys.<br><br>Secure boot is implemented in a straightforward way. Each section of a PE-COFF file is added together and a hash taken[1]. This hash is signed with the private half of a signing key and embedded into the binary. When you attempt to execute a file under UEFI, the firmware attempts to decrypt the embedded hash. This requires that the firmware have a either a copy of the public half of the signing key in its key database, or for there to be a chain of trust from the signing key to a key in its key database. Once it has the decrypted hash, it generates its own hash of the binary and compares them. If they match, the binary is executed.<br><br>What happens if it doesn't match? Per the UEFI specification, the firmware can then prompt the user and ask if they want to execute it anyway. If the user accepts then the hash of the binary is remembered[4] and can continue to be executed in future. This is similar to what you get when you visit a self-signed https site, or when you connect to an ssh server for the first time - the user must explicitly state that they trust the software that is being booted.<br><br>This is a little awkward for a couple of reasons. First, it means that any updates to the bootloader would require the user to manually accept the binary again. Second, as we've seen with https, there's the risk of uesrs just blindly accepting things. If it's acceptable to do this off internal media[5] then malware could just rely on some number of users saying \"yes\". And thirdly, we've been told that Microsoft's Windows logo requirements forbid this option.<br><br>The first is problematic but manageable with appropriate documentation. The second is a real risk that makes this approach far less compelling. And the third is probably a showstopper.<br><br>So signed but untrusted binaries are probably out, on technological, UI and policy grounds. What else?<br><br>We can sign binaries with a trusted key. This gets us interoperability, but comes at a cost. The first issue here is that we still don't know what the process for getting a trusted key is going to be. One option is for something like a generic Linux key that's provided by all firmware vendors. As long as the OEM doesn't remove it, then that Linux key could be used to sign other keys that are used by individual Linux vendors. The main difficulty involved in this is having the Linux key be managed by an authority that OEMs can trust to only provide keys to trustworthy organisations and maintain control of the private half of the key. Remember, if any malware is signed with any of these keys, it'll boot on any machine carrying this key. It's a lot of trust. It's not obvious that there's an organisation with sufficient trust at the moment.<br><br>The second approach is for each Linux vendor to generate their own key and get every OEM to carry it. Let's rule this out on the basis that it's an approach that doesn't scale at all. Red Hat could probably get its key into a bunch of OEM systems. Canonical too. Oracle? Probably for the vendors they care about. It's likely to be much harder for everyone else, and you still end up with the risk that you've just bought a computer that'll boot Red Hat but not Ubuntu.<br><br>The third approach is for each Linux vendor to obtain a key from someone who's already trusted. The most obvious authority here is Microsoft. Ignoring the PR unpleasantness involved with Linux vendors having to do business with Microsoft to get signed, so far Microsoft haven't given us any indication that this will be possible.<br><br>So every approach that involves us signing with a trusted key comes with associated problems. There's also a common problem with all of them - you only get to play if you have your own trusted key. Corporate Linux vendors can probably find a way to manage this. Everyone else (volunteer or hobbyist vendors, end users who want to run their own OS, anyone who wants to use a modified bootloader or kernel) is shut out.<br><br>The obvious workaround is for them to just turn off secure boot. Ignoring the arguments over whether or not OEMs will provide that option[6], it benefits nobody for Linux installation to require disabling a legitimate security feature. It's also not likely to be in a standard location on all systems and may have different naming. It's a support nightmare. Let's focus on trying to find a solution that provides the security and doesn't have obvious scaling issues.<br><br>There's a pretty simple one. If the problem centres around installing signing keys, why not have a standardised way of installing signing keys?<br><br>What we've proposed for this is an extension of the current UEFI standard for booting off removable media. There's a standardised location for putting the bootloader for USB sticks or optical media. For 32-bit PCs, it's EFI/BOOT/BOOTIA32.EFI. For 64-bit, it's EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.EFI. Our proposal is to specify a path for key storage on the media. If the user attempts to boot off an item of removable media and finds a key file, we would like the firmware to prompt the user to install the key. Once the key is installed, the firmware will attempt to boot the bootloader on the removable media.<br><br>How does this avoid the problems associated with prompting the user to boot untrusted binaries? The first is that there's no problem with updates. Because a key has been imported, as long as future bootloader updates are signed with the same key, they'll boot without prompting the user. The second is that it can be limited to removable media. If malware infects the system and installs itself onto the hard drive, the firmware won't prompt for key installation. It'll just refuse to boot and fall back on whatever recovery procedures the OEM has implemented. The only way it could get on the system would involve the user explicitly booting off removable media, which would be a significant hurdle. If you're at that stage then you can also convince the user to disable secure boot entirely.<br><br>This proposal has been brought up with the UEFI standards working group, and with the UEFI plugfest taking place next week we're hoping it'll be discussed. It seems to satisfy the dual requirements of maintaining system security and ensuring that users have the flexibility to choose what they run on their system. But as with all technical proposals, feedback is entirely welcome.<br><br>[1] Hilariously, Microsoft's signing tool gets this wrong by also adding the contents of gaps between sections in direct contravention of their own specification. This is fine for binaries generated by Microsoft's toolchain because they don't have any gaps, but since our binaries <em>do</em> contain gaps[2] and since the standard firmware implementation[3] <em>does</em> implement the specification correctly, any Linux-generated binaries signed with the Microsoft tool fail validation. Go team.<br>[2] Something that is, as far as we can tell, permitted by the PE-COFF specification<br>[3] Written by Intel, not Microsoft<br>[4] Note that this means that only the specific binary is considered trusted. No key is imported, and any other binaries signed with the same key will also need to be manually trusted in the same way.<br>[5] As would be required if you ever want to be able to update your bootloader<br>[6] And to forestall panic, at this point we expect that most OEMs <em>will</em> provide this option on most hardware, if only because customers will still want to boot Windows 7. We do know that some hardware will ship without it. It's not implausible that some OEMs will remove it in order to reduce their support burden. But for the foreseeable future, you'll be able to buy hardware that runs Linux.<br><br><img src=\"http://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=mjg59&amp;ditemid=6503\" alt=\"comment count unavailable\" height=\"12\" style=\"vertical-align:middle\" width=\"30\"> comments"

The\nsender found the bug by accident, and asked me why I didn't do some\nmore publicity here. So here we are.</p>\n<p>I won't go into details on what grsecurity is, it's fairly\ncomplex. But it's basically a hardening patch for the Linux kernel,\nwith three main components:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the PaX patch, which purpose is to harden the memory layout of\nthe Linux kernel and improve existing options: enforcing of\nnon-executable memory pages (userland and in kernel), W^X (no page\nmarked as writable and executable), ASLR, prevention of invalid\nuserland pointers dereference, copies between userland and kernel\nmemory…</li>\n<li>RBAC (Role Based Access Control), an implementation of\nMandatory Access Control</li>\n<li>various hardening features: /proc restrictions, chroot\nrestrictions, kernel symbols hiding etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A lot of this touches low level stuff in the kernel, especially\nmemory management. Ideally this patch would be pushed upstream, but\nBrad Spengler (grsecurity main developper) already said he wasn't\ninterested in upstreaming it and upstream already said the patch\nwas too huge and invasive to include it like that (especially since\nthe original authors aren't interested in maintaining it upstream).\nThere's an ongoing effort to split the patch and merge things\nlittle by little, but in the meanwhile having a mid-term solution\nwould be nice.</p>\n<p>I know Debian users rebuilding grsecurity-patched kernels\nthemselves, and I know some of them would appreciate having them\nincluded in the Debian kernel. Fortunately, the linux-2.6 source\npackage has a nice feature which is called <em>featureset</em>.\nBasically it's a way to build some (binary) packages using a\ndifferent set of patches and a different config. For example this\nwas used to provide xen/openvz/vserver patchsets, and is now used\nto provide rt kernels.</p>\n<p>So I though it'd be nice to provide a grsec featureset, and\nstarting doing the work. I have a working setup for producing those\nkernels, so I've opened a wishlist bug against the kernel (<a href=\"http://bugs.debian.org/605090\">#605090</a>) to have this\nmerged.</p>\n<p>Those packages follow the sid kernel. There's an ongoing work\nfor Squeeze, but it's a bit harder there because both the\ngrsecurity patchset and the Debian kernel ship a whole lot of\nbackports to the Linux kernel, meaning the grsecurity patch doesn't\napply directly to the Debian source package. Basically I need to\nremove some of the hunks (since they are already applied to the\nsource) and port some others (since there are some backported code\nnot present in the vanilla 2.6.32, for example the drm code).</p>\n<p>Until the patches are merged and the bug is closed, I host some\nof the built packages at:</p>\n<p>deb\nhttp://molly.corsac.net/~corsac/debian/kernel-grsec/packages/\nsid/</p>\n<p>The repository is signed by my <a href=\"http://www.corsac.net/../71ef0ba8.asc\">key</a>\nwhich you can add to your apt setup using apt-key add. If you want\nto rebuild the packages yourself, here's the method:</p>\n<p>mkdir kernel-grsec<br>\ncd kernel-grsec<br>\nsvn checkout\nsvn://svn.debian.org/svn/kernel/dists/sid/linux-2.6<br>\ngit clone\ngit://anonscm.debian.org/users/corsac/grsec-patches.git<br>\nwget\nhttp://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v3.0/linux-3.0.tar.bz2<br>\nwget\nhttp://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v3.0/linux-3.0.tar.bz2.sign<br>\n\ngpg --verify linux-3.0.tar.bz2<br>\ncd linux-2.6<br>\napt-get build-dep linux-2.6<br>\nexport QUILT_PATCHES=../grsec-patches<br>\nquilt push -a<br>\npython debian/bin/genorig.py ../linux-3.0.tar.bz2<br>\ndebian/rules orig<br>\nfakeroot debian/rules source<br>\nfakeroot make -f debian/rules.gen binary-arch_amd64_grsec_amd64</p>\n<p>You could also do dpkg-buildpackage, pdebuild or whatever.\n<a href=\"http://kernel-handbook.alioth.debian.org/\">Kernel\nhandbook</a> is a nice reading too if you want more information on\nhow to rebuild Debian kernels. The quilt push -a may fail if you\ncheckout an svn version more recent than mine. I try to keep\npatches up to date but I usually have some delay.</p>\n<p>Note that installing the kernel will require installing\nlinux-grsec-base package.

      "content" : "<p></p><p>As mentioned in the <a title=\"Qt Creator editor news\" href=\"http://labs.qt.nokia.com/2011/09/28/qt-creator-editor-news/\">recent editor news blog post</a>, we have been working on integrating <a title=\"Clang\" href=\"http://clang.llvm.org/\">Clang</a> as a replacement for our current C++ code-model in Qt Creator. While we are still in an early stage, we feel that it is now in a state where others can look at it, play with it, and even contribute to it.</p>\n<p>Now I hear some people thinking: “But I already have a compiler!” I get this reaction a lot when I tell this to people. So first of all: a code-model is not a compiler, so you still need your own favourite one.</p>\n<h4>What is a code-model, what does it do?</h4>\n<p>The code-model is the part of an IDE that “understands” the language you are using to write your application. It is the framework which allows us to provide:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>code-completion</li>\n<li>highlighting (both syntactically and semantically)</li>\n<li>navigation (the locator, follow symbol, etc)</li>\n<li>introspection (the class browser, the outline, etc)</li>\n<li>diagnostics and tool-tips</li>\n<li>find usages and renaming</li>\n<li>refactoring actions</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As such it needs to have a parser for the language, and the semantic analyses. The only difference with a compiler is that a code-model does not generate an executable.</p>\n<h4>Why switch to Clang?</h4>\n<p>Switching from our current code-model to Clang gives us some important improvements. Most notable of these is that Clang is an actual compiler which means that the information we get out of it is correct. So the feedback you get through warning and error markers is the same as the compiler will give you, not an incomplete set or a close approximation. When we are talking about those diagnostics: Clang focusses on detailed information for diagnostics, which is really useful in those rare cases where a developer makes a typo <img src=\"http://labs.qt.nokia.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":-)\"> </p>\n<p>Also, Clang already supports C++98/03, C89 and C99, Objective-C (and Objective-C++), and <a title=\"C++11 support\" href=\"http://clang.llvm.org/cxx_status.html\">C++11 support</a> is in active development.</p>\n<p>But all those good things do not come for free. When using Clang as code-model it does not need to generate object files, but it still needs to parse and analyse the source files. For small projects which only use STL, this works okay. But for bigger projects like Qt Creator, which uses large parts of Qt, processing a single file <em>and all the included files</em> can take a while. For this we use one or more pre-compiled headers, and with the current integration you will have to manually add them to your project or point Qt Creator to it. More details below.</p>\n<h4>What is switched already?</h4>\n<p>The current integration uses Clang for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>syntactic highlighting (“keyword highlighting”) and semantic highlighting (types/methods/fields/labels/etc)</li>\n<li>code-completion</li>\n<li>diagnostics</li>\n<li>code navigation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please notice that some of the above items still only work in a limited range of situations.</p>\n<h4>Where to get it</h4>\n<p>First you need to compile Clang/LLVM, either version 3.0 or trunk. Build instructions can be found <a href=\"http://clang.llvm.org/get_started.html\">on the LLVM website</a>. If you want to use git instead of svn, use <a href=\"http://llvm.org/git/llvm.git\">llvm.git</a> and <a href=\"http://llvm.org/git/clang.git\">clang.git</a>. Please make sure that you do a release (optimised) build!</p>\n<p>The Qt Creator integration is in the wip/clang branch in the git repository on gitorious. Building Qt Creator works as usual: run qmake, then make, and depending on your platform a make install. If you are on Linux/Mac and do not have the directory with llvm-config in your path, or if you are on Windows, you can use the <code>LLVM_INSTALL_DIR</code> qmake variable to tell qmake where to find the Clang/LLVM libraries and headers.</p>\n<p>When starting Qt Creator, make sure the clang libraries are in the library search path by including the <code>&lt;llvm-install-prefix&gt;/lib</code> directory in your <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> (Linux), or in the PATH (Windows).</p>\n<h4>How to use it</h4>\n<p>You can use this version of Qt Creator as you would do with any other version. However, there is one thing to keep in mind: if you use big libraries like Qt or Boost in your project, you can speed up the code-model (and therefore the highlighting and completion) quite a bit by defining one or more pre-compiled header(s). For a typical Qt project, this header can consist of:</p>\n<pre>#ifndef PCH_H\n#define PCH_H\n\n#include &lt;QtCore&gt;\n#include &lt;QtGui&gt;\n\n#endif // PCH_H</pre>\n<p>Only header files that do not change (so those which are part of the system), otherwise the pre-compiled header needs to be re-generated, which in turn negates the caching advantage.</p>\n<p>There are two ways to do tell Qt Creator to use this header as a cache:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you use qmake, then you can set the PRECOMPILED_HEADER variable in your .pro file:<br>\n<code>PRECOMPILED_HEADER = pch.h</code><br>\nDepending on the qmake spec file for your compiler, this pre-compiled header might also be used for compilation.</li>\n<li>When you go to the “Projects” <strong>mode</strong>, you will see an extra tab with “Code Completion Settings”, where you can select a “custom” header. When selecting this option, the code-model will use that header as a cache, but the compiler will not use it.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>How to contribute</h4>\n<p>As mentioned at the beginning of this post, this release is mainly targeted towards people who would like to contribute, because no, we are not finished. There is still quite some work to do, so if you feel like helping out, let us know! The main communication channel is the qtcreator <a title=\"Qt-creator mailing-list\" href=\"http://lists.qt.nokia.com/mailman/listinfo/qt-creator\">mailing-list</a>, and <tt>#qt-creator</tt> on freenode.</p>"

      "content" : "<i>This post is made in a personal capacity. While it represents the outcome of multiple discussions on the topic with a variety of people, nothing written below should be construed as Red Hat's corporate position</i><br><br>The FSF have <a href=\"http://www.fsf.org/campaigns/secure-boot-vs-restricted-boot\">released a statement</a> on UEFI secure boot. It explains the fundamental issue here, which isn't something as simple as \"will OEMs let me install Linux\". It's \"Does the end user have the ability to manage their own keys\".<br><br>Secure boot is a valuable feature. It does neatly deal with the growing threat of pre-OS malware. There is an incentive for it to be supported under Linux. I discussed the technical aspects of implementing support for it <a href=\"http://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/6054.html\">here</a> - it's not a huge deal of work, and it is being worked on. So let's not worry about that side of things. The problem is with the keys.<br><br>Secure boot is implemented in a straightforward way. Each section of a PE-COFF file is added together and a hash taken[1]. This hash is signed with the private half of a signing key and embedded into the binary. When you attempt to execute a file under UEFI, the firmware attempts to decrypt the embedded hash. This requires that the firmware have a either a copy of the public half of the signing key in its key database, or for there to be a chain of trust from the signing key to a key in its key database. Once it has the decrypted hash, it generates its own hash of the binary and compares them. If they match, the binary is executed.<br><br>What happens if it doesn't match? Per the UEFI specification, the firmware can then prompt the user and ask if they want to execute it anyway. If the user accepts then the hash of the binary is remembered[4] and can continue to be executed in future. This is similar to what you get when you visit a self-signed https site, or when you connect to an ssh server for the first time - the user must explicitly state that they trust the software that is being booted.<br><br>This is a little awkward for a couple of reasons. First, it means that any updates to the bootloader would require the user to manually accept the binary again. Second, as we've seen with https, there's the risk of uesrs just blindly accepting things. If it's acceptable to do this off internal media[5] then malware could just rely on some number of users saying \"yes\". And thirdly, we've been told that Microsoft's Windows logo requirements forbid this option.<br><br>The first is problematic but manageable with appropriate documentation. The second is a real risk that makes this approach far less compelling. And the third is probably a showstopper.<br><br>So signed but untrusted binaries are probably out, on technological, UI and policy grounds. What else?<br><br>We can sign binaries with a trusted key. This gets us interoperability, but comes at a cost. The first issue here is that we still don't know what the process for getting a trusted key is going to be. One option is for something like a generic Linux key that's provided by all firmware vendors. As long as the OEM doesn't remove it, then that Linux key could be used to sign other keys that are used by individual Linux vendors. The main difficulty involved in this is having the Linux key be managed by an authority that OEMs can trust to only provide keys to trustworthy organisations and maintain control of the private half of the key. Remember, if any malware is signed with any of these keys, it'll boot on any machine carrying this key. It's a lot of trust. It's not obvious that there's an organisation with sufficient trust at the moment.<br><br>The second approach is for each Linux vendor to generate their own key and get every OEM to carry it. Let's rule this out on the basis that it's an approach that doesn't scale at all. Red Hat could probably get its key into a bunch of OEM systems. Canonical too. Oracle? Probably for the vendors they care about. It's likely to be much harder for everyone else, and you still end up with the risk that you've just bought a computer that'll boot Red Hat but not Ubuntu.<br><br>The third approach is for each Linux vendor to obtain a key from someone who's already trusted. The most obvious authority here is Microsoft. Ignoring the PR unpleasantness involved with Linux vendors having to do business with Microsoft to get signed, so far Microsoft haven't given us any indication that this will be possible.<br><br>So every approach that involves us signing with a trusted key comes with associated problems. There's also a common problem with all of them - you only get to play if you have your own trusted key. Corporate Linux vendors can probably find a way to manage this. Everyone else (volunteer or hobbyist vendors, end users who want to run their own OS, anyone who wants to use a modified bootloader or kernel) is shut out.<br><br>The obvious workaround is for them to just turn off secure boot. Ignoring the arguments over whether or not OEMs will provide that option[6], it benefits nobody for Linux installation to require disabling a legitimate security feature. It's also not likely to be in a standard location on all systems and may have different naming. It's a support nightmare. Let's focus on trying to find a solution that provides the security and doesn't have obvious scaling issues.<br><br>There's a pretty simple one. If the problem centres around installing signing keys, why not have a standardised way of installing signing keys?<br><br>What we've proposed for this is an extension of the current UEFI standard for booting off removable media. There's a standardised location for putting the bootloader for USB sticks or optical media. For 32-bit PCs, it's EFI/BOOT/BOOTIA32.EFI. For 64-bit, it's EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.EFI. Our proposal is to specify a path for key storage on the media. If the user attempts to boot off an item of removable media and finds a key file, we would like the firmware to prompt the user to install the key. Once the key is installed, the firmware will attempt to boot the bootloader on the removable media.<br><br>How does this avoid the problems associated with prompting the user to boot untrusted binaries? The first is that there's no problem with updates. Because a key has been imported, as long as future bootloader updates are signed with the same key, they'll boot without prompting the user. The second is that it can be limited to removable media. If malware infects the system and installs itself onto the hard drive, the firmware won't prompt for key installation. It'll just refuse to boot and fall back on whatever recovery procedures the OEM has implemented. The only way it could get on the system would involve the user explicitly booting off removable media, which would be a significant hurdle. If you're at that stage then you can also convince the user to disable secure boot entirely.<br><br>This proposal has been brought up with the UEFI standards working group, and with the UEFI plugfest taking place next week we're hoping it'll be discussed. It seems to satisfy the dual requirements of maintaining system security and ensuring that users have the flexibility to choose what they run on their system. But as with all technical proposals, feedback is entirely welcome.<br><br>[1] Hilariously, Microsoft's signing tool gets this wrong by also adding the contents of gaps between sections in direct contravention of their own specification. This is fine for binaries generated by Microsoft's toolchain because they don't have any gaps, but since our binaries <em>do</em> contain gaps[2] and since the standard firmware implementation[3] <em>does</em> implement the specification correctly, any Linux-generated binaries signed with the Microsoft tool fail validation. Go team.<br>[2] Something that is, as far as we can tell, permitted by the PE-COFF specification<br>[3] Written by Intel, not Microsoft<br>[4] Note that this means that only the specific binary is considered trusted. No key is imported, and any other binaries signed with the same key will also need to be manually trusted in the same way.<br>[5] As would be required if you ever want to be able to update your bootloader<br>[6] And to forestall panic, at this point we expect that most OEMs <em>will</em> provide this option on most hardware, if only because customers will still want to boot Windows 7. We do know that some hardware will ship without it. It's not implausible that some OEMs will remove it in order to reduce their support burden. But for the foreseeable future, you'll be able to buy hardware that runs Linux.<br><br><img alt=\"comment count unavailable\" height=\"12\" src=\"http://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=mjg59&amp;ditemid=6503\" style=\"vertical-align:middle\" width=\"30\"> comments"

And my\nupstreams' build systems rarely work 100% out of the box with dh<em>auto</em>*\nwithout one override or another somewhere.  So in practice, the shortest\ndebian/rules file in any of my packages seems to be 13 lines currently.</p>\n\n<p>But that's 13 lines of almost 100% signal, unlike the bad old days of\ncut'n'pasted dh_* command lists.</p>\n\n<p>The biggest benefit, though, isn't in making it shorter to write a rules\nfile with the old, standard build options.  The biggest benefit is that\ndpkg-buildflags now also outputs build-hardening compiler and linker flags\nby default on Debian.  Specifically, using the new interface lets you pick up\nall of these hardening flags for free:</p>\n\n<pre><code>-fstack-protector --param=ssp-buffer-size=4 -Wformat -Wformat-security -Werror=format-security -Wl,-z,relro\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It also lets you get <code>-fPIE</code> and <code>-Wl,-z,now</code> by adding this one line to\nyour debian/rules (assuming you're using <code>dh(1)</code> and compat 9):</p>\n\n<pre><code>export DEB_BUILD_MAINT_OPTIONS := hardening=+pie,+bindnow\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Converting all my packages to use <code>dh(1)</code> has always been a long-term goal,\nbut some packages are easier to convert than others.  This was the tipping\npoint for me, though.  Even though debhelper compat level 9 isn't yet frozen,\nmeaning there might still be other behavior changes to it that will make more\nwork for me between now and release, over the past couple of weekends I've\nbeen systematically converting all my packages to use it with <code>dh</code>.  In\nparticular, pam and samba have been rebuilt to use the default hardening\nflags, and openldap uses these flags plus PIE support.  (Samba already\nbuilds with PIE by default courtesy of upstream.)</p>\n\n<p>You can't really make samba and openldap out on\n<a href=\"http://people.debian.org/~cjwatson/dhstats.png\">the graph</a>, but they're\nthere (with their rules files reduced by 50% or more).</p>\n\n<p>I cannot overstate the significance of proactive hardening.  There have been\na number of vulnerabilities over the past few years that have been thwarted\non Ubuntu because Ubuntu is using <code>-fstack-protector</code> by default.  Debian has\na great security team that responds quickly to these issues as soon as\nthey're revealed, but we don't always get to find out about them before\nthey're already being exploited in the wild.  In this respect, Debian has\nlagged behind other distros.</p>\n\n<p>With dpkg-buildflags, we now have the tools to correct this.  It's just a\nmatter of getting packages to use the new interfaces.  If you're a maintainer\nof a security sensitive package (such as a network-facing daemon or a setuid\napplication), please enable dpkg-buildflags in your package for wheezy!\n(Preferably with PIE as well.)  And if you don't maintain security sensitive\npackages, you can still help out with the <a href=\"http://wiki.debian.org/ReleaseGoals/SecurityHardeningBuildFlags\">hardening release\ngoal</a>.</p>"

This book will be named <a href=\"http://debian-handbook.info\">The Debian Administrator’s Handbook</a> because it has primarily been written for Debian.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ulule.com/debian-handbook/\"><img src=\"http://raphaelhertzog.com/files/2011/09/d-a-h-ulule-banner-300x168.png\" title=\"The Debian Administrator&#39;s Handbook\" height=\"168\" width=\"300\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<h3>Creating a new Ubuntu book based on The Debian Administrator’s Handbook</h3>\n<p>But since Ubuntu is based on Debian, a large part of its content applies equally well to Ubuntu. While discussing with Mark Shuttleworth, he suggested me to reuse those parts and to create a new book dedicated to Ubuntu. It would also cover the latest cloud technologies that Ubuntu has been delivering (since this is a topic that the current book does not cover).</p>\n<p>This is something that I have been envisioning for a while and something that I would be ready to try if we manage to complete the liberation of the current book. This project would then bring a truly free book to the Ubuntu ecosystem.</p>\n<h3>Why? The official Ubuntu books are not really free</h3>\n<p>There’s a policy in place that ensures that official Ubuntu books use a free software/culture license and they are effectively available under the terms of a Creative Commons Share Alike license. But try to create a derivative book… <strong>you won’t find the “sources”</strong> (LaTeX or DocBook usually with most big books). <strong>You can only find a few PDF copies</strong> if you google for it. But this is really not the preferred form of modification for such a book.</p>\n<p>Those books are also not packaged. Ubuntu much like Debian deserves to have a good book embodying the values of free software that can be shipped together with its product.</p>\n<p>When I speak of liberation of the book, I really mean it in the way that free software hackers are used to: a public Git repository containing the DocBook sources, the pictures and the .dia files for the various schemas.</p>\n<h3>Help Ubuntu by spreading the word</h3>\n<p>I understand that at this point this proposed Ubuntu book is really hypothetical (“vaporware” one could say) but we need to go step by step to make it a reality. And the first step is to ensure that we manage to liberate the Debian Administrator’s Handbook.</p>\n<p>For this I am seeking the support of the Ubuntu community to promote the current fundraising campaign. If the perspective of the Ubuntu book is not enough to convince you, you’ll be glad to learn that <strong>I also commit to give back to Ubuntu 15% of the money raised</strong> via the link below (once VAT has been subtracted).</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://debian-handbook.info/go/ulule-ubuntu/\">Click here to go to the crowdfunding campaign page</a> and pledge a few euros</strong>. Then share this article (or the link <a href=\"http://debian-handbook.info/go/ulule-ubuntu/\">http://debian-handbook.info/go/ulule-ubuntu/</a>) and convince others to participate.</p>\n<p>At this point, the liberation target is entirely reachable with your help and the help of the community: the remaining 18 K€ needed in the liberation fund represent 720 persons giving 25 EUR each or 1800 persons giving 10 EUR each.</p>\n<p>Thank you very much for your support and your help in this project!</p>\n<p style=\"font-size:smaller\"><a href=\"http://raphaelhertzog.com/2011/10/18/what-about-creating-the-ubuntu-administrators-handbook/#comments\">One comment</a> | Liked this article? <a href=\"http://raphaelhertzog.com/support-my-work/\">Click here</a>. | My blog is <a href=\"http://flattr.com/thing/26545/apt-get-install-debian-wizard\">Flattr-enabled</a>.</p>\n<p></p>"

Une plateforme qui ferait reposer ses fondations sur deux piliers : l'accessibilité et la sécurité. Et plus encore l'accessibilité, car au fond, plateforme = accessibilité. Chose qui manque à Google :\n<blockquote><em>We don’t get Platforms, and we don’t get Accessibility. The two are basically the same thing, because platforms solve accessibility. A platform is accessibility.</em></blockquote>\nSelon lui, Google ne sait pas réaliser ni ne comprend ce qu'est une plateforme, et Google+ est le premier exemple de cette absence de culture \"plateforme\" :\n<blockquote><em>That one last thing that Google doesn’t do well is Platforms. We don’t understand platforms. We don’t “get” platforms.\n...it’s like our tenth or eleventh priority. Or fifteenth, I don’t know. It’s pretty low.\nThe Google+ platform is a pathetic afterthought. We had no API at all at launch...\nThis is a cultural thing...</em></blockquote>\nChez Google, d'abord nous tentons d'anticiper ce que les gens veulent, et après nous le leur donnons. Or ce n'est pas vraiment comme ça que ça marche. Cette approche n'est pas fiable. Steve Jobs pouvait faire ça, mais nous n'avons pas de Steve Jobs chez Google, désolé (sic!) :\n<blockquote><em>The problem is that we are trying to predict what people want and deliver it for them.\nYou can’t do that. Not really. Not reliably. There have been precious few people in the world, over the entire history of computing, who have been able to do it reliably. Steve Jobs was one of them. We don’t have a Steve Jobs here. I’m sorry, but we don’t.</em></blockquote>\nLarry appréciera :-)\n\nD'après son analyse, Google+ ne serait qu'une réaction pavlovienne à courte vue, basée sur le postulat erroné que Facebook est une réussite parce qu'ils ont mis au point un bon produit. Ce qui est faux : le succès de Facebook est qu'ils ont construit une plateforme en permettant aux autres de développer une constellation de produits, ce qui permet à chacun d'avoir une expérience différente, personnelle, sur Facebook. Certains passent tout leur temps sur <a href=\"http://adscriptum.blogspot.com/2010/12/quest-ce-que-la-mafia.html\">Mafia Wars</a>, d'autres sur Farmville, etc. Il y a des centaines voire des milliers de silos de contenus où perdre son temps, on y trouve tout pour tous.\n<blockquote><em>Google+ is a knee-jerk reaction, a study in short-term thinking, predicated on the incorrect notion that Facebook is successful because they built a great product. But that’s not why they are successful. Facebook is successful because they built an entire constellation of products by allowing other people to do the work. So Facebook is different for everyone. Some people spend all their time on Mafia Wars. Some spend all their time on Farmville. There are hundreds or maybe thousands of different high-quality time sinks available, so there’s something there for everyone.</em></blockquote>\nIl n'y a pas que Facebook qui a réussi à développer une plateforme, il en va de même pour d'autres, chacun pour ses propres raisons, comme Amazon (toute la partie sur Jeff Bezos est impayable), Microsoft, Apple ou Twitter, mais pas Google.\n\nOr un produit qui n'est associé à aucune plateforme finira toujours par être remplacé par un produit pouvant tourner sur une plateforme (<em>A product is useless without a platform, or more precisely and accurately, a platform-less product will always be replaced by an equivalent platform-ized product</em>). L'important étant de donner à des tierces parties la possibilité de développer leurs propres applis pour les greffer automatiquement sur la plateforme, après quoi tout se fera naturellement (<em>He just needed to enable third-party developers to do it, and it would happen automatically</em>).\n\nIl ne s'agit pas non plus de lancer d'abord les produits pour espérer en faire une plateforme ouverte, magique et extensible dans un deuxième temps, ce qu'a déjà tenté Google sans y réussir (<em>We can’t keep launching products and pretending we’ll turn them into magical beautiful extensible platforms later. We’ve tried that and it’s not working</em>), mais plutôt de <strong>commencer par la plateforme, et de l'utiliser ensuite pour tous les produits et services</strong>. Même si elle n'est pas parfaite dès le départ, il sera toujours temps de la peaufiner après, l'important c'est de le faire de suite. Car même s'il n'est pas encore trop tard, plus Google attend et plus ce sera difficile et coûteux de mettre correctement en place cette stratégie :\n<blockquote><em><strong>The Golden Rule of Platforms</strong>, “Eat Your Own Dogfood”, can be rephrased as “<strong>Start with a Platform, and Then Use it for Everything.</strong>” You can’t just bolt it on later. Certainly not easily at any rate — ask anyone who worked on platformizing MS Office. Or anyone who worked on platformizing Amazon. If you delay it, it’ll be ten times as much work as just doing it correctly up front. You can’t cheat. You can’t have secret back doors for internal apps to get special priority access, not for ANY reason. You need to solve the hard problems up front.</em>\n\n<em> </em><em>I’m not saying it’s too late for us, but the longer we wait, the closer we get to being Too Late.</em></blockquote>\nJ'arrête là le résumé de son analyse, qu'il a ruminé pendant 6 ans (<em>This post has been six years in the making</em>), pour terminer sur la question qui m'est venue à la lecture de ce billet :\n\n<strong>Que serait Google si c'était une plateforme ?</strong>\n\nIl est déjà dur de cerner ce qu'est Google, sinon une compagnie qui va bientôt <a href=\"http://www.google.com/finance?q=NASDAQ:GOOG\">capitaliser 200 milliards de $</a> (je me rappelle encore quand <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2009/10/05/googled-schmidt-wants-to-build-a-100-billion-media-company/\">Eric Schmidt disait qu'il voulait faire de Google une compagnie média pesant ... 100 milliards de $</a>...)

      "content" : "<p><strong>Update: </strong>I got some feedback from this article asking things like “Wouldn’t it be easier to achieve this with ctype, cython, etc” and here is my answer: Yes it would! However most of these approaches would include a performance penalty and the purpose of this post was to demostrate how to create a Python extension and I already had the face detection C code from <a title=\"Computer Vision with OpenCV\" href=\"http://raphaelcruzeiro.com/blog/2011/08/05/computer-vision-with-opencv/\">my previous OpenCV article</a>. I’m planning on trying face recognition using the other approaches suggested to me and creating a benchmark to show whether I’m right on believing there would be this overhead with the other approaches.</p>\n<p>This article is kind of a two-in-one, I’ll demonstrate how to create an extension to Python written in C and how to take the power of OpenCV to the web. In order to follow this article you must have OpenCV installed on your system, if you don’t have OpenCV you can read <a title=\"Computer Vision with OpenCV\" href=\"http://raphaelcruzeiro.com/blog/2011/08/05/computer-vision-with-opencv/\">my previous article</a> to learn how to get and compile OpenCV (there’s a small adjustment to be made on OpenCV’s source code if you’re planning to compile it on a Mac machine).</p>\n<p>While OpenCV does indeed have a Python API, it can be quite difficult to get it running and as it’s so easy to extend Python with C or C++ and we can leverage the performance of these languages to process images it makes sense to write the processing algorithm in these languages and then wrap it with a Python extension.</p>\n<p>I’ll be using the same facial detection technique used on my previous OpenCV article though this time we’ll apply it to still pictures and not video. We want something that can be used in Python like this:</p>\n<pre>import face\nface_list = face.detect('/Users/raphaelcruzeiro/Documents/people.jpg')</pre>\n<p>Now that we know how we want our Python code to look like we can then proceed to create the extension in C. Let’s create a file named <em>facerecognition.c</em> and a <em>setup.py.  </em>On our <em>setup.py</em> we’ll specify the C source, the include path and the libraries we’re going to use:</p>\n<pre>from distutils.core import setup, Extension\n\nmodule1 = Extension('face',\n                    include_dirs = ['/usr/local/include'],\n                    libraries = ['opencv_core', 'opencv_objdetect'],\n                    library_dirs = ['/usr/local/lib'],\n                    sources = ['facerecognition.c']\n                    )\n\nsetup (name = 'Face CV Web',\n       version = '1.0',\n       description = 'A computer vision module.',\n       ext_modules = [module1])</pre>\n<p>This script will then be used to compile our extension. And now to the C code on <em>facerecognition.c</em>:</p>\n<pre>#include &lt;Python.h&gt;\n#include &lt;opencv/cv.h&gt;\n\n#include &lt;opencv2/highgui/highgui_c.h&gt;\n\n/* We&#39;ll store any errors encountered during the execution */\nstatic PyObject *FaceError;\n\nCvHaarClassifierCascade *cascade;\nCvMemStorage            *storage;\n\nPyObject *detectFaces(IplImage *img)\n{\n    int i;\n\n    /* Detect all faces on the frame */\n    CvSeq *faces = cvHaarDetectObjects(\n                                       img,\n                                       cascade,\n                                       storage,\n                                       1.1,\n                                       3, 0,\n                                       cvSize(50, 50),\n                                       cvSize(50, 50)\n                                      );\n\n    /* This is how we create a Python list from C */\n    PyObject *result = PyList_New(0);\n\n    /* Now, let&#39;s mark each face */\n    for(i = 0 ; i &lt; (faces ? faces-&gt;total : 0) ; i++) {\n        CvRect *r = (CvRect*)cvGetSeqElem(faces, i);\n\n        /*\n            I&#39;m creating dictionaries to represent the face&#39;s\n            position as dictionaries are considerably easier\n            to create than custom objects and can be easily serialized\n            to JSON on out Python code.\n            To create a Python dictionary all you have to do is to call\n            the Py_BuildValue function with a a formatting mask with\n            brackets, the &#39;s&#39; represents a string, the &#39;i&#39;represents a\n            number and the &#39;O&#39; represents a Python object, so if I want\n            to create a Python dictionary like &quot; { x : 5, y : 1 } &quot; all\n            I have to do is use the mask &quot;{sisi}&quot;.\n        */\n        PyObject *origin = Py_BuildValue(\n                                         &quot;{sisi}&quot;,\n                                         &quot;x&quot;,\n                                         r-&gt;x,\n                                         &quot;y&quot;,\n                                         r-&gt;y\n                                        );\n        PyObject *size = Py_BuildValue(\n                                       &quot;{sisi}&quot;,\n                                       &quot;width&quot;,\n                                       r-&gt;width,\n                                       &quot;height&quot;,\n                                       r-&gt;height\n                                      );\n        PyObject *rect = Py_BuildValue(\n                                       &quot;{sOsO}&quot;,\n                                       &quot;origin&quot;,\n                                       origin,\n                                       &quot;size&quot;,\n                                       size\n                                      );\n\n        PyList_Append(result, rect);\n    }\n\n    return result;\n}\n\nstatic PyObject *\nface_detect(PyObject *self, PyObject *args)\n{\n    const char *path;\n    int sts;\n\n    if (!PyArg_ParseTuple(args, &quot;s&quot;, &amp;path))\n        return NULL;\n\n    IplImage* frame;\n\n    /* OpenCV stores the Haar Cascades for default on this location */\n    char *file = &quot;/usr/local/share/opencv/&quot;\n        &quot;/haarcascades/haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml&quot;;\n\n    cascade = (CvHaarClassifierCascade*)cvLoad(file, 0, 0, 0);\n    storage = cvCreateMemStorage(0);\n\n    IplImage* image = cvLoadImage(path, CV_LOAD_IMAGE_COLOR);\n\n    if(image == NULL) {\n        PyErr_SetString(FaceError, &quot;Image not found!&quot;);\n        return NULL;\n    }\n\n     PyObject *result = detectFaces(image);\n\n     cvReleaseHaarClassifierCascade(&amp;cascade);\n     cvReleaseMemStorage(&amp;storage);\n     cvReleaseImage(&amp;image);\n\n     return result;\n}\n\nstatic PyMethodDef FaceMethods[] = {\n    {&quot;detect&quot;,  face_detect, METH_VARARGS,\n     &quot;Detect the faces on an image.&quot;},\n    {NULL, NULL, 0, NULL}        /* Sentinel */\n};\n\nPyMODINIT_FUNC\ninitface(void)\n{\n    PyObject *m;\n\n    m = Py_InitModule(&quot;face&quot;, FaceMethods);\n    if (m == NULL)\n        return;\n\n    FaceError = PyErr_NewException(&quot;face.error&quot;, NULL, NULL);\n    Py_INCREF(FaceError);\n    PyModule_AddObject(m, &quot;error&quot;, FaceError);\n}</pre>\n<p>That may seem like a lot to take in at once but it is in reality quite simple. A <em>PyObject</em> is a data structure that represents a Python object, this data structure contains the object’s reference count and a pointer to the objects’type. Unless we’re defining a new kind of Python object we can create our object using <em>Py_BuildObject</em>, this is done to create dictionaries on the above code.<br>\nTo create a Python dictionary all you have to do is to call the <em>Py_BuildValue</em> function with a formatting mask with brackets, the <em>s</em> represents a string, the <em>i</em> represents a number and the <em>O </em>represents a Python object, so if you want to create a Python dictionary like ” { x : 5, y : 1 } ” all you have to do is use the mask “{sisi}”.</p>\n<p>To make your functions visible to Python you must create a method definition table (<em>PyMethodDef</em>) and add it to the module initialization. Also on the module initialization you should initialize the <em>FaceError</em> variable as a Python exception to be thrown if there is an error opening the file, not doing so will cause Python to receive a SIGABRT from the OS.</p>\n<p>To compile our module just type the command:</p>\n<pre>python setup.py build</pre>\n<p>And copy the resulting module, <em>face.so, </em>to Python’s <em>site-packages</em> directory.</p>\n<p>You should now be able to call the module from Python like this:</p>\n<pre>import face\nface_list = face.detect('/Users/raphaelcruzeiro/Documents/people.jpg')</pre>\n<h3>Using the extension on a real application</h3>\n<p>I’ve created a sample Django application that leverages on this face detection capabilities exposed by our extension. While I won’t discuss every aspect of the Django application as it is out of the scope of this post, I’ll just show here the key aspects of the application (a link to the source repository can be found at the bottom of the article).</p>\n<p>The web app allows the user to upload an image and then displays it on the browser. When the image is displayed an AJAX call is made to the server to evaluate the image and supply the client-side with the position of the faces.</p>\n<pre>from face import detect as _detect\n\ndef detect(request):\n    print request.POST\n\n    id = request.POST['id']\n    image = ModelImage.objects.get(pk=id)\n\n    return HttpResponse(json.dumps(_detect(image.img.path)))</pre>\n<p>This is how the server-side handles the AJAX request to process the image and this is how the AJAX call is made and the response processed on the client-side:</p>\n<pre>$(document).ready(function(){\n    $.post(&#39;{% url detect_url %}&#39;, &#39;id={{ id }}&#39;, function(data){\n        $.each(data, function(i, f){\n            var face = $(&#39; &lt;div style=&quot;background: blue; opacity: 0.5; position: absolute;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&#39;).css({\n                &#39;top&#39; : f.origin.y + &#39;px&#39;,\n                &#39;left&#39; : f.origin.x + &#39;px&#39;,\n                &#39;height&#39; : f.size.height + &#39;px&#39;,\n                &#39;width&#39; : f.size.width + &#39;px&#39;\n            });\n\n            $(&#39;#mask&#39;).append(face);\n        })\n        }, &#39;json&#39;);\n});</pre>\n<p>The image is contained within a relative positioned <em> div </em> with the id mask and our script basically adds an absolute positioned <em>div </em>on top of each face returned on the JSON response.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://raphaelcruzeiro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Screen-Shot-2011-10-17-at-1.49.32-AM1.png\"><img title=\"Face detection test\" src=\"http://raphaelcruzeiro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Screen-Shot-2011-10-17-at-1.49.32-AM1-300x136.png\" alt=\"Face detection test\" width=\"300\" height=\"136\"></a></p>\n<p>The full source code of this article can be found on <a href=\"https://github.com/raphaelcruzeiro/Face-Detector\">https://github.com/raphaelcruzeiro/Face-Detector</a></p>"

In real-world application, you can use other types of standard Qt dialogs and possibly even create your own custom dialog.</p>\n\n<div><div><pre><span>void</span> Dialog<span>::</span><span>showMessage</span><span>(</span><span>const</span> <span>QString</span> <span>&amp;</span>msg<span>)</span>\n<span>{</span>\n    <span>QMessageBox</span><span>::</span><span>information</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>&quot;Information&quot;</span><span>,</span> msg<span>)</span><span>;</span>\n<span>}</span></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Once we have the instance of the above <code>Dialog</code> class, we inject it into our web page using <a href=\"http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.8/qwebframe.html#addToJavaScriptWindowObject\">addToJavaScriptWindowObject</a> as follow:</p>\n\n<div><div><pre>   <span>QWebFrame</span> <span>*</span>mainFrame <span>=</span> webView.<span>page</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>mainFrame</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>\n   mainFrame<span>-&gt;</span><span>addToJavaScriptWindowObject</span><span>(</span><span>&quot;Dialog&quot;</span><span>,</span> <span>new</span> Dialog<span>)</span><span>;</span></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Now, whenever you want to pop up the dialog, i.e. via the handler of that <em>Show Message</em> button (which is just a normal <code>input</code> element), call it like this:</p>\n\n<div><div><pre>    Dialog.<span>showMessage</span><span>(</span>document.<span>getElementById</span><span>(</span><span>'msg'</span><span>)</span>.<span>value</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>This is the simplest possible Qt and WebKit bridging example I can think of, so that’s all!</p>"

It allows me to see, at one glance, whether I can reach the router, the internet and/or my VPN. Furthermore, the latency display tells me whether there is a point in working over SSH right now. I often observe other people, e.g. on conferences, to stare for a while at a non-loading web page, then fire up a terminal window and run random ping commands, while I immediately see that the network is down and can relax.</p> \n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://launchpadlibrarian.net/52090195/link-monitor-logarithmic.png\"></div> \n<p>Unfortunately, Jean-Yves seems to have stopped working on link-monitor-applet and does not reply to <a href=\"https://bugs.launchpad.net/link-monitor-applet\">bug reports</a>. This was not a big deal as long as I could use the last released version with <a href=\"http://patch-tracker.debian.org/package/link-monitor-applet/\">minor patches of mine</a>, but now gnome-panel 3 is coming up and all applets need <a href=\"http://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/migrating.html\">porting to GTK3</a>. Yesterday and today I worked on that, and got it so far that the applet is fully functional, although the visual styling is not perfect yet, because I’m not sure how to do what Jean-Yves did with GtkStyle and GdkGC now with GtkStyleContext and Cairo. The code is in the <a href=\"http://git.nomeata.de/?p=link-monitor-applet.git;a=shortlog;h=refs/heads/gnome3\">gnome3 branch</a> of my git repository.<br></p> \n<p>For this issue, and any further maintenance work, I’m looking for someone who is willing to take upstream responsibility for link-monitor-applet, e.g. making sure it works with the latest GNOME (well, GNOME in fallback mode) and that bug reports are handled. The code base is not too big, and both the non-standard build system and the gob-enhanced C code are fine to work with. I’ll still be happy to serve as the maintainer of the <a href=\"http://packages.debian.org/sid/link-monitor-applet\">Debian package of link-monitor-applet</a>.<br></p> <br><a href=\"https://flattr.com/submit/auto?user_id=nomeata&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.joachim-breitner.de%2Fblog%2Farchives%2F525-Help-wanted-maintaining-link-monitor-applet.html&amp;title=Help+wanted+maintaining+link-monitor-applet&amp;description=Jean-Yves+Lefort%E2%80%99s+link-monitor-applet%2C+an+applet+for+the+GNOME+panel%2C+is+a+great+tool+for+those+with+often-changing+and+possibly+unreliable+network+connection.+It+allows+me+to+see%2C+at+one+glance%2C+whether+I+can+reach+the+router%2C+the+internet+and%2For+my+VPN.+Furthermore%2C+the+latency+display+tells+me+whether+there+is+a+point+in+working+over+SSH+right+now.+I+often+observe+other+people%2C+e.g.+on+conferences%2C+to+stare+for+a+while+at+a+non-loading+web+page%2C+then+fire+up+a+terminal+window+and+run+random+ping+commands%2C+while+I+immediately+see+that+the+network+is+down+and+can+relax.++++++Unfortunately%2C+Jean-Yves+seems+to+have+stopped+working+on+link-monitor-applet+and+does+not+reply+to+bug+reports.+This+was+not+a+big+deal+as+long+as+I+could+use+the+last+released+version+with+minor+patches+of+mine%2C+but+now+gnome-panel+3+is+coming+up+and+all+applets+need+porting+to+GTK3.+Yesterday+and+today+I+worked+on+that%2C+and+got+it+so+far+that+the+applet+is+fully+functional%2C+although+the+visual+styling+is+not&amp;category=text&amp;language=en_GB\">Flattr this post</a>"

Ritchie, creator of the C Programming Language, the UNIX Operating System, The Plan 9 Operating System and many other key contributions to computing, passed away due an extended illness. I learned about it yesterday <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/101960720994009339267/posts/ENuEDDYfvKP\">trough Rob Pike</a>, former dmr’s colleague and friend.</p>\n<p>I’m writing this post to honor him and his legacy. While I’ve seen people mourn his departure, I’ve also noticed most technical people don’t really understand why his work is important for today’s computing, so I’m here to give a refresh. Since I’m good with visual tools (mindmaps) I’ve made one to describe the extension of dmr’s contribution to the world. You can get a glimpse of how this is important. The main topics are their key contributions, the sub-topics are the current technologies that were built upon dmr’s work.

The focus on simplicity by giving just a small set of tools is where it’s power resides. Most operating systems available, and in development, today are written in C. Most of the services that make the Internet work have been programmed in C. C also influenced other languages such as C++, Objective-C, even Python and Google’s Go.</div>\n<div><strong>The UNIX operating system</strong></div>\n<div>Today’s Internet rely in UNIX-like operating systems running crucial services such DNS, webservers, email servers, etc. Nothing of this could be possible without an Operating system that was built with the simplicity and design that it has. The vision/philosophy behind is where it’s power resides. “write programs that do one thing and do it well”. The GNU Project, Linux, the *BSD where conceived on the idea of replicating such invention. Even Windows has some UNIX bits inside.</div>\n<div><strong>IPC</strong></div>\n<div>This is probably the less-known Dennis Ritchie’s contribution. Today is crucial. Web “2.0″ would not be able to be AJAXian if there was not IPC. IPC means Interprocess Communication, simply put: make two system processes exchange messages. This foundation was key for concepts such threads, RPC and others. Today’s AJAX relies on the RPC concept, for instance.</div>\n<div>So, either you are programming the next hot Web 2.0 or just writing a C program for playing with sockets remember there were giants on which shoulders you are standing now. Thank you Dennis, I have the book.</div>\n<div>“UNIX is very simple, it just needs a genius to understand its simplicity.” -Dennis Ritchie</div>"

      "content" : "<p>The launch of Apple iPhone few years ago popularizes the use of flick list, a touch-friendly list interface with a bit of physics when hitting the edge and scrolling. This effect is often known as <em>momentum scrolling</em> (although personally I prefer the more romantic term, <em>kinetic scrolling</em>).</p>\n<p>Ages ago I was involved with the C++ and Qt side of this in the form of <a href=\"http://labs.qt.nokia.com/2008/11/15/flick-list-or-kinetic-scrolling/\">Flick Charm</a> (a magic spell to <em>flickify</em> any <a href=\"http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.8/qabstractscrollarea.html\">QAbstractScrollArea</a>) and <a href=\"http://labs.qt.nokia.com/2009/07/19/kinetic-scrolling-on-any-widgets/\">Flickable</a> (base class to enable flicking on any widget). The code is structured around a simple state-machine, making it easy to understand and debug. Note: you may collapse <em>Pressed</em> and <em>Stop</em> states, they were two separate ones due to a workaround which is not needed anymore.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/6-C8GONsD7zEJDw0_LcZtQ?feat=embedwebsite\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-qFWcR_u0SQU/St3bSQsHyUI/AAAAAAAABZo/EMhtOojLoks/s400/kinetic_scrolling.png\"></a></p>\n<p>For the mobile web, there have been attempts to reimplement this flick list concept using pure JavaScript. Out there, you can find projects like <a href=\"https://github.com/davidaurelio/TouchScroll\">TouchScroll</a>, <a href=\"http://cubiq.org/iscroll\">iScroll</a>, <a href=\"http://joehewitt.github.com/scrollability/\">Scrollability</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/zynga/scroller\">Zynga Scroller</a>, and many others. The idea is rather straightforward: handle touch events yourself so that you can simulate the scrolling behavior that suits your need. This way, the lack of <code>position:fixed</code> and/or <code>overflow:scroll</code> is nicely compensated.</p>\n<p><em>Aller guten Dinge sind drei</em>. Third time is a charm. My third attempt to have a simplified way enabling kinetic scrolling was far from finished. I already put the initial <a href=\"http://gitorious.org/ofi-labs/x2/commit/79b8932d\">usable version</a> (also <a href=\"http://gitorious.org/ofi-labs/x2/commit/8ccb334f\">ported</a> to JavaScript) <em>more than a year ago</em>. Rather than waiting for perfection, I decide to dissect one particular part which is my favorite: the deceleration. Also, now it comes both in C++/Qt and JavaScript flavors. To keep this blog post as short as possible, I’d focus <em>only</em> on the deceleration itself. Topics around rubberband/bouncing effect, snapping, direct style setting vs CSS3 animation, etc will be reserved for any future discussion.</p>\n<p>When I started to work on Flick Charm 3 years ago, I did not pay attention carefully to the way the scrolling works on iPhone. I was just assuming that the deceleration is based on Newton’s <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton&#39;s_laws_of_motion\">law of motion</a>, i.e. a moving body receiving a friction which is forced to stop after a while. After a while, I realized that this is actually <strong>not</strong> how iPhone (and later iOS devices such as iPad) does it. Using a camera and capturing few dozens scrolling movement of various iOS applications, it came to me that all the scrolling will stop <em>after the same amount of time</em>, regardless the size of the list or the speed of the flick. How fast you flick (which determines the initial velocity of the scrolling) only determines <strong>where</strong> the list would stop and not <strong>when</strong>.</p>\n<p>(If you are a professional working with high-speed photography, I invite you to do the above camera analysis. By using a suitable high-speed camera, I’m fairly confident that the precise movement of every pixel can be accounted for, and thus would help to verify my postulate above. For example, this could be a nice episode of <em>Mythbusters</em>!)</p>\n<p>This observation led me to believe that the momentum scrolling is a sort of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_decay\">exponential decay</a>. It is characterized by the speed of the decay. There are two different ways to express it: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life\">half-life</a> (remember radioactive decay?) or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_constant\">time constant</a>. For the latter, it is very much related to the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Step_response\">step response</a> of a first order system. In other words, the deceleration system is just an overdamped <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring%E2%80%93mass_system\">spring-mass system</a>. Turns out, everything is still based on <i>physics</i>.</p>\n<p>Note: Since two-dimension scrolling (x and y) is just a linear combination of two independent flick movements, it’s easier to implement the deceleration for each axis and then combine the result. For the rest of the blog post, this would be the assumption.</p>\n<p>A clever trick to set the scrolling position based on the exponential decay is by using the fact that it slows down at a rate proportional to its value. This simplifies the math of the deceleration a lot, there is no need for complicated way to keep track of the time, velocity, tweening using Bézier curve, etc.</p>\n<p>The code to implement this above decay is ridiculously simple, here is one way to do it:</p>\n\n<div><div><pre>amplitude <span>=</span> initialVelocity <span>*</span> scaleFactor<span>;</span>\nstep <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>\n \nticker <span>=</span> setInterval<span>(</span><span>function</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>\n    <span>var</span> delta <span>=</span> amplitude <span>/</span> timeConstant<span>;</span>\n    position <span>+=</span> delta<span>;</span>\n    amplitude <span>-=</span> delta<span>;</span>\n    step <span>+=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>\n    <span>if</span> <span>(</span>step <span>&gt;</span> <span>6</span> <span>*</span> timeConstant<span>)</span> <span>{</span>\n        clearInterval<span>(</span>ticker<span>)</span><span>;</span>\n    <span>}</span>\n<span>}</span><span>,</span> updateInterval<span>)</span><span>;</span></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>We choose to stop after scrolling for about 6x the time constant because at that point the new position will be within 0.25% of the target position. Another variant would be to stop when the scrolling movement enters the subpixel area (i.e. it is going really slow). The time unit can be arbitrary, but be careful to normalize it with the timer resolution of <code>setInterval</code>. Using the above code fragment, the position as a function of time is depicted in the following graph (each tick in the horizontal axis represents the time constant):</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ariya.ofilabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/kinetic-deceleration.png\"><img src=\"http://ariya.ofilabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/kinetic-deceleration.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"kinetic-deceleration\" width=\"372\" height=\"235\"></a></p>\n<p>In fact, this is how the deceleration is implemented in Apple’s own <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1143589/what-is-the-pastrykit-framework\">PastryKit</a> library (and now <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/iphone/appstore/iad/\">part of iAd</a>). It reduces the scrolling speed by a factor of 0.95 for each animation tick (16.7 msec, targeting 60 fps). This corresponds to a time constant of 325 msec. If you are a math geek, then obviously you realize that the exponential nature of the scroll velocity will yield the exponential decay in the position. With a little bit of scriblling, eventually you find out that <em>325</em> is <em>-16.7 / ln(0.95)</em>.</p>\n<p>The time constant itself is the solution to the two values of <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIScrollView_Class/Reference/UIScrollView.html\">decelerationRate</a> in <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIScrollView_Class/Reference/UIScrollView.html\">UIScrollView</a>: <em>normal</em> vs <em>fast</em>. Various scrollable lists in typical iOS applications are using a normal deceleration rate. However, UIWebView seems to be on the fast side. This is evidenced when you use Safari to browse a long web page as flicking the web page scrolls much less than as if you flick on e.g. the contact list. Usually, Safari completes the scrolling in less than half a second.</p>\n<p>If you choose to have a slightly slower method, at the added benefit of being more robust against slower frame rate (see Android problem below), use the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_decay#Solution_of_the_differential_equation\">solution</a> of the differential equation of the exponential decay:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ariya.ofilabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/kinetic-differential.png\"><img src=\"http://ariya.ofilabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/kinetic-differential.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"kinetic-differential\" width=\"168\" height=\"43\"></a></p>\n\n<div><div><pre>amplitude <span>=</span> initialVelocity <span>*</span> scaleFactor<span>;</span>\ntargetPosition <span>=</span> position <span>+</span> amplitude<span>;</span>\ntimestamp <span>=</span> Date.<span>now</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>\n \nticker <span>=</span> setInterval<span>(</span><span>function</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>\n    <span>var</span> elapsed <span>=</span> Date.<span>now</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>-</span> timestamp<span>;</span>\n    position <span>=</span> targetPosition <span>-</span> amplitude <span>*</span> Math.<span>exp</span><span>(</span><span>-</span>elapsed <span>/</span> timeConstant<span>)</span><span>;</span>\n    <span>if</span> <span>(</span>elapsed <span>&gt;</span> <span>6</span> <span>*</span> timeConstant<span>)</span> <span>{</span>\n        clearInterval<span>(</span>ticker<span>)</span><span>;</span>\n    <span>}</span>\n<span>}</span><span>,</span> updateInterval<span>)</span><span>;</span></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>(If you want to have snap-to-grid feature, there is a subtle hint in the above code fragment!)</p>\n<p>Should you think that computing the exponent for every frame is too expensive, you can cache the values. If the time constant is 325 msec and the scrolling stops completely after ~2 seconds, with 60 fps animation you will only need an array with 120 values. <a href=\"http://addyosmani.com/blog/faster-javascript-memoization/\">Memoize</a> this array based on the time constant and now you avoid calling <code>Math.exp</code> all the time. This comes at an expense, you won’t be able to adjust for degraded actual frame rate.</p>\n<p>The online demo for mobile WebKit is available at <a href=\"http://ariya.github.com/js/kinetic\">ariya.github.com/js/kinetic</a> (actually, it’s been there for a year!). The source code is easier to get from my <a href=\"http://github.com/ariya/x2\">code example repository</a> (or <a href=\"http://gitorious.org/ofi-labs/x2\">the mirror</a>), look at <code>javascript/kinetic</code> for the web and <code>widget/kineticmodel</code> for native (C++ and Qt). For the latter, there is a simple example <code>widget/namelist</code>. In both cases, the code should be generic enough and can be reused for other types of scrolling.</p>\n<p>For the content of the web version, I pick the first four letters from Robert Walton in the famous <em>Frankenstein</em> novel. When viewed in portrait, the usual smartphone will render the text element as long as 4000 pixels, thus making it a nice stress test for the scroller.</p>\n<p>For a good measure, I also included a primitive frame counter, measuring the amount of the handler for the timer is invoked averaged for the last few seconds. It’s likely not terribly accurate (depending on the platform, some rendering-related part may run asynchronously on a different thread), but it’s good to have a quantitative index of the performance. In addition, the scroll indicator on the left side is intentional, this is to avoid easy confusion with a native scroll bar (which would not appear if everything works properly). And even if you are going offline right after, the demo should still work since it leverages application cache.</p>\n<p>On typical iOS devices, such as iPhone and iPad, scrolling very close to <strong>60 fps</strong> is easily within reach. Nokia N9 or N950, due to <a href=\"http://ariya.ofilabs.com/2011/08/first-look-at-nokia-n950-web-browser.html\" title=\"first look at nokia n950 web browser\">its excellent browser</a>, can get the same performance without any problem. As for Android phones, partially due to the lack of GPU compositing (a topic for another blog post), it does really depend on the hardware power, e.g. <a href=\"http://www.google.com/phone/detail/nexus-s\">Nexus S</a> won’t likely go beyond 25 fps. For your pleasure, enjoy the complete performance chart below (many thanks to my linguist friend Donald Carr and also Ronny and Espen for providing the results for Galaxy S II). Note that since rendering is always related to the number of pixels on the screen, be cautious when doing the comparison.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/PhENgUggzzFZ4XjI9hfn4g?feat=embedwebsite\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-nM978kUI0xY/TpUsq9snIiI/AAAAAAAACNo/aFa-TjCVh20/s800/kinetic-deceleration-perf.png\" height=\"260\" width=\"600\"></a></p>\n<p>Obviously, if you really want the frame rate of 60 fps or more, adjust the timer update interval to be less than 16.7 msec. That way, there would be more processor time allocated for the computation part and thus the intended fluid scrolling is easier to achieve. For example, setting the update interval to 0 will push the speed to over 75 fps on those iOS devices.</p>\n<p>What about <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-animations/\">CSS3 animation</a>? It’s fantastic to use this new animation system because (depending on the system) <a href=\"http://ariya.ofilabs.com/2011/07/fluid-animation-with-accelerated-composition.html\" title=\"fluid animation with accelerated composition\">it can be composited</a> (and thus, easily <a href=\"http://www.sencha.com/blog/understanding-hardware-acceleration-on-mobile-browsers/\">GPU accelerated</a>). The performance is expected to be better because instead of calculating the position for every frame, we let the rendering engine (in its native code) to deal with it. Instead of using the built-in <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-animations/#animation-timing-function\">animation timing function</a> (based on cubic <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve\">Bézier curve</a>), custom deceleration can be perfectly achieved using keyframes. This trick is used e.g. in Scrollability, read <a href=\"http://joehewitt.com/2011/10/05/fast-animation-with-ios-webkit\">the blog post</a> from Joe Hewitt for more detailed info.</p>\n<p>When I find some spare time, I’d like to discuss some follow-ups such as edge bouncing, snapping (which should be easy already), optimized keyframes generation, and other related topics. Till then, enjoy the momentum!</p>"

Now, that is really a tedious thing to do. You go on a website such as <a href=\"http://www.opensubtitles.org/en\">opensubtitles.org</a> and type the title of what you are looking for. Then you usually have to choose from a plethora of results, download the archive, unzip it, fire up <span>VLC</span>, go to Video → Subtitles Track → Open File, and finally open your subtitles file. And what you typically find out at that point is that the subtitles are completely out of sync with the audio, but rather than doing the whole process again you prefer to just sync them with a bit of <span>VLC</span>-fu. Which always takes longer than you thought, but hey.</p>\n<p>Now, what if there was an extremely simple way to just choose the subtitles for a given movie <strong>directly from <span>VLC</span></strong>?</p>\n<p>The good news is that somebody wrote a beautiful <span>VLC</span> extension that does exactly that. He also wrote an <a href=\"http://jpeg.dinauz.org/blog/index.php?post/2010/01/30/Extensions-in-VLC\">introductory article about <span>VLC</span> extensions</a>. Thank you, Jean-Philippe André.</p>\n<p>Installing the thing is as simple as downloading <a href=\"http://addons.videolan.org/CONTENT/content-files/141787-subtitles-mod.lua\">the subtitles extension</a> and putting it in the <span>VLC</span> scripts folder. On Linux machines, the extensions folder can be found at ~/.local/share/vlc/lua/extensions/, on Windows <span><span>APPDATA</span></span>\\<span>VLC</span>\\lua\\extensions. But seriously, don’t use Windows.</p>\n<p>Once the extension is installed you can start watching a movie and then click View → Subtitles to open the subtitles search interface.</p>\n<p>This is how it looks like:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/lvpSa.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Now that the practical problem is solved, please take some time to look at <a href=\"http://addons.videolan.org/CONTENT/content-files/141787-subtitles-mod.lua\">the source code</a>. <span>VLC</span> uses Lua as the language for writing extensions. I certainly cannot say that the web is full of resources about how to extend <span>VLC</span> using Lua, but the piece of code I wrote about in this post is certainly a good way to start hacking, and maybe scratch yet another itch.</p>"

Like in previous benchs, <em>stunnel</em> is not able to\nscale, with a maximum of 400 <abbr title=\"Transactions per second\"><span>TPS</span></abbr>. However, early latency issues of\n<em>nginx</em> has been solved, thanks to the change in configuration. <em>stud</em>\nand <em>nginx</em> gets similar performance but, as you can see on the bottom\nplot (whose scale is logarithmic) <em>stud</em> starts with an initial\nlatency of 40 ms.</p>\n<p>This is pretty annoying. I have tried some\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bumptech/stud/pull/37\">micro optimization to solve this issue</a> but without\nluck. If latency matters for you, stick with <em>stunnel</em> or <em>nginx</em> (or\nfind where the problem lies in <em>stud</em>).</p>\n<p><strong><span>UPDATED</span>:</strong> After reporting this issue, a\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bumptech/stud/commit/7ad212a3f8\">fix has been commited</a>. The culprit was\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagle&#39;s_algorithm\">Nagle’s algorithm</a> which improves bandwidth at the expense of\nlatency.

He <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/mtrojnar/status/110912432519659520\">told me</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/mtrojnar/status/110914736979316737\">on Twitter</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I solved it! You compiled stunnel against a 4 years old OpenSSL with\n<span>MT</span>-unsafe <code>SSL_accept</code>. Upgrade OpenSSL and rebuild stunnel. This\nbug was fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.0b.

For example,\nDebian Squeeze ships with OpenSSL 0.9.8o, Ubuntu Lucid with 0.9.8k and\n<abbr title=\"Red Hat Enterprise Linux\"><span>RHEL</span></abbr> 5.7 with 0.9.8e. Therefore, they are not eligible to recent\nperformance improvements. To solve this, Intel released\n<a href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/mailing.openssl.dev/msg/01a427c7b424d9a5\">Intel Accelerator Engine</a>, which also brings, among\nother things, <abbr title=\"Advanced Encryption Standard\"><span>AES</span></abbr>-<span>NI</span> support:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is essentially a collection of assembler modules from\ndevelopment OpenSSL branch, packed together as a standalone engine.\n“Standalone” means that it can be compiled outside OpenSSL source\ntree without patching the latter.

Unfortunately, this library is\nnot free, not even as in “free beer”. The patch provided by Intel only\napplies on OpenSSL 0.9.8j. Simon updated it for OpenSSL 1.0.0d. It\nalso applies with a slight modification to OpenSSL 1.0.0e. Look at\n<a href=\"http://zombe.es/post/5183420528/accelerated-ssl\">Simon’s article</a> for instructions on how to compile\nOpenSSL with <span>IPP</span>.</p>\n<p>Simon measured 220% improvement on <span>RSA</span> 1024-bit private key operations\nby using this library. Unfortunately, we don’t get such a performance\nburst with <em>stud</em> which exhibits a 15% improvement (but remember that\nprivate key operations only happen once every 8 transactions thanks to\nsession reuse). Worst, with <em>stunnel</em>, performances are reduced by one\nthird and <em>nginx</em> just segfaults. I think such a library is risky to\nuse in production.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://d1g3mdmxf8zbo9.cloudfront.net/images/benchs-ssl/stud-stunnel-ipp.png\" alt=\"stud and stunnel with IPP\"></p>\n<h2>Hyperthreading</h2>\n<p>During the previous tests, only half the capacity of each core were\nused. For <em>stud</em>, adding more workers per core only slightly improves\nthis situation (less than 10% with 4 workers per core). Therefore, I\nthought using hyperthreading could rectify the situation here. In this\ncase, <em>stud</em>, <em>stunnel</em> and <em>nginx</em> are allocated 8 “virtual” cores\ninstead of 4. <em>stud</em> only got a small improvement of 5%, <em>nginx</em> a\nmoderate improvement of 11% while <em>stunnel</em> got a significant\nimprovement of 26%.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://d1g3mdmxf8zbo9.cloudfront.net/images/benchs-ssl/stud-stunnel-nginx-ht.png\" alt=\"stud, stunnel and nginx with hyperthreading\"></p>\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>Here is a quick recap of the maximum <abbr title=\"Transactions per second\"><span>TPS</span></abbr> reached on each tests (while\nkeeping average response time below 100 ms). All tests were run on 4\nphysical cores with 2048-bit certificates, <span>AES128</span>-<span>SHA</span> cipher\nsuite. Each client makes 8 <span>HTTP</span> requests and reuse the first <abbr title=\"Secure Sockets Layer\"><span>SSL</span></abbr> session.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Context</th>\n<th>nginx 1.1.4</th>\n<th>stunnel 4.44</th>\n<th>stud <a href=\"https://github.com/vincentbernat/stud/tree/e207dbc5a3d5c2753a4d83794780edf6edb2e3fb\">@e207dbc5a3</a></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>OpenSSL 0.9.8k</td>\n<td>1489 <abbr title=\"Transactions per second\"><span>TPS</span></abbr></td>\n<td>400 <abbr title=\"Transactions per second\"><span>TPS</span></abbr></td>\n<td>1492 <abbr title=\"Transactions per second\"><span>TPS</span></abbr></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>OpenSSL 1.0.0e</td>\n<td>1501 <abbr title=\"Transactions per second\"><span>TPS</span></abbr></td>\n<td>1561 <abbr title=\"Transactions per second\"><span>TPS</span></abbr></td>\n<td>1609 <abbr title=\"Transactions per second\"><span>TPS</span></abbr></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>OpenSSL 1.0.0e + <span>IPP</span></td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>1101 <abbr title=\"Transactions per second\"><span>TPS</span></abbr></td>\n<td><strong>1857 <abbr title=\"Transactions per second\"><abbr title=\"Transactions per second\"><span>TPS</span></abbr></abbr></strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>OpenSSL 1.0.0e + <span>HT</span></td>\n<td><strong>1718 <abbr title=\"Transactions per second\"><abbr title=\"Transactions per second\"><span>TPS</span></abbr></abbr></strong></td>\n<td><strong>1973 <abbr title=\"Transactions per second\"><abbr title=\"Transactions per second\"><span>TPS</span></abbr></abbr></strong></td>\n<td>1694 <abbr title=\"Transactions per second\"><span>TPS</span></abbr></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>I also would like to stress that below 1500 <abbr title=\"Transactions per second\"><span>TPS</span></abbr>, <em>stunnel</em> adds an\noverhead of a few milliseconds while <em>stud</em> adds 40 milliseconds. With\nOpenSSL 1.0.0e and hyperthreading enabled, <em>stunnel</em> has both good\nperformance and low latency on low loads to moderate loads. You may\njust want to limit the number of allowed connections to avoid\ncollapsing on high loads. While in the <a href=\"http://vincent.bernat.im/en/blog/2011-ssl-benchmark.html\">previous round</a>, <em>stud</em>\nwas the champion and <em>stunnel</em> lagged behind, the situation is now\nreversed : <em>stunnel</em> is on top!</p>\n<p><strong><span>UPDATED</span>:</strong> As said earlier, the latency issue with <em>stud</em>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bumptech/stud/commit/7ad212a3f8\">has been solved</a>.

Over 700 people were arrested. More and more people came to parade on Wall Street. It also aroused some heavy media coverage in China. Hundreds of residents of Zhengzhou, the capital of Henan province rallied to support the movement of Occupy Wall Street in front of Labor People’s Cultural Center on October 6th.</p>\n<p><span></span>\n<p>Holding banners which wrote &quot;Absolutely support the American people’s great ‘Occupy Wall Street revolution’&quot;, people gathered and passed around flyers about the event happening in New York. They wore red armbands and showed their support to this movement. The demonstrators were consisted of workers, cadres of state-owned enterprise and some retirees. A cadre from a state-owned enterprise said &quot;USA is so bad that it bullies any countries as it wishes. Bullying others with its rod of liberal democracy, it interferes with the internal affairs of other countries and overthrows the regimes of other. Now it’s time for pay back of its evil. The true colors of USA are coming out.&quot; A young man who also took part in the rally analyzed the reason of the Occupy Wall Street movement that the capitalism had reached its end and the people in capitalist countries were woken up. Another middle-aged person from Shandong province gave his opinions that the socialism can save China, but also the world. </p>\n<p><img

Originally I wrote this introduction for my <a href=\"http://www.catonmat.net/blog/sed-book/\">second e-book</a>, however later I decided to make it a part of the <a href=\"http://www.catonmat.net/download/sedbook-preview.pdf\">free e-book preview</a> and republish it here as this article.</p>\n<h2>Introduction to sed</h2>\n<p>Mastering sed can be reduced to understanding and manipulating <i>the four spaces</i> of sed. These four spaces are:</p>\n<ul><li>Input Stream</li>\n<li>Pattern Space</li>\n<li>Hold Buffer</li>\n<li>Output Stream</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Think about the spaces this way - sed reads the input stream and produces the output stream. Internally it has the pattern space and the hold buffer. Sed reads data from the input stream until it finds the newline character <code>\\n</code>. Then it places the data read so far, without the newline, into the pattern space. Most of the sed commands operate on the data in the pattern space. The hold buffer is there for your convenience. Think about it as temporary buffer. You can copy or exchange data between the pattern space and the hold buffer. Once sed has executed all the commands, it outputs the pattern space and adds a <code>\\n</code> at the end.</p>\n<p>It's possible to modify the behavior of sed with the <code>-n</code> command line switch. When <code>-n</code> is specified, sed doesn't output the pattern space and you have to explicitly print it with either <code>p</code> or <code>P</code> commands.</p>\n<p>Let's look at several examples to understand the four spaces and sed. These are just examples to illustrate what sed looks like and what it's all about.</p>\n<p>Here is the simplest possible sed program:</p>\n<pre>\nsed 's/foo/bar/'\n</pre>\n<p>This program replaces text \"<code>foo</code>\" with \"<code>bar</code>\" on every line. Here is how it works. Suppose you have a file with these lines:</p>\n<pre>\nabc\nfoo\n123-foo-456\n</pre>\n<p>Sed opens the file as the input stream and starts reading the data. After reading \"<code>abc</code>\" it finds a newline <code>\\n</code>. It places the text \"<code>abc</code>\" in the pattern space and now it applies the <code>s/foo/bar/</code> command. Since we have \"<code>abc</code>\" in the pattern space and there is no \"<code>foo</code>\" anywhere, sed does nothing to the pattern space. At this moment sed has executed all the commands (in this case just one). The default action when all the commands have been executed is to print the pattern space, followed by newline. So the output from the first line is \"<code>abc\\n</code>\".</p>\n<p>Now sed reads in the second line \"<code>foo</code>\" and executes <code>s/foo/bar/</code>. This replaces \"<code>foo</code>\" with \"<code>bar</code>\". The pattern space now contains just \"<code>bar</code>\". The end of the script has been reached and sed prints out the pattern space, followed by newline. The output from the second line is \"<code>bar\\n</code>\".</p>\n<p>Now the 3rd line is read in. The pattern space is now \"<code>123-foo-456</code>\". Since there is \"<code>foo</code>\" in the text, the <code>s/foo/bar/</code> is successful and the pattern space is now \"<code>123-bar-456</code>\". The end is reached and sed prints the pattern space. The output is \"<code>123-bar-456\\n</code>\".</p>\n<p>All the lines of the input have been read at this moment and sed exits. The output from running the script on our example file is:</p>\n<pre>\nabc\nbar\n123-bar-456\n</pre>\n<p>In this example we never used the hold buffer because there was no need for temporary storage.</p>\n<p>Before we look at an example with temporary storage, let's take a look at three command line switches: <code>-n</code>, <code>-e</code> and <code>-i</code>. First <code>-n</code>.</p>\n<p>If you specify <code>-n</code> to sed, like this:</p>\n<pre>\nsed -n 's/foo/bar/'\n</pre>\n<p>Then sed will no longer print the pattern space when it reaches the end of the script. So if you run this program on our sample file above, there will be no output. You must use sed's <code>p</code> command to force sed to print the line:</p>\n<pre>\nsed -n 's/foo/bar/; p'\n</pre>\n<p>As you can see, sed commands are separated by the <code>;</code> character. You can also use <code>-e</code> switch to separate the commands:</p>\n<pre>\nsed -n -e 's/foo/bar/' -e 'p'\n</pre>\n<p>It's the same as if you used <code>;</code>. Next, let's take a look at the <code>-i</code> command line argument. This one forces sed to do in-place editing of the file, meaning it reads the contents of the file, executes the commands, and places the new contents back in the file.</p>\n<p>Here is an example. Suppose you have a file called \"<code>users</code>\", with the following content:</p>\n<pre>\npkrumins:hacker\nesr:guru\nrms:geek\n</pre>\n<p>And you wish to replace the \"<code>:</code>\" symbol with \"<code>;</code>\" in the whole file. Then you can do it as easily as:</p>\n<pre>\nsed -i 's/:/;/' users\n</pre>\n<p>It will silently execute the <code>s/:/;/</code> command on all lines in the file and do all substitutions. <strong>Be very careful when using <code>-i</code> as it's destructive and it's not reversible!</strong> It's always safer to run sed without <code>-i</code>, and then replace the file yourself.</p>\n<p>Alternatively you can specify a file extension to the <code>-i</code> command. This way <code>sed</code> will make a backup copy of the file before it makes in-place modifications.</p>\n<p>For example, if you specify <code>-i.bak</code>, like this:</p>\n<pre>\nsed -i.bak 's/:/;/' users\n</pre>\n<p>Then <code>sed</code> will create <code>users.bak</code> before modifying the contents of <code>users</code> file.</p>\n<p>Actually, before we look at the hold buffer, let's take a look at addresses and ranges. Addresses allow you to restrict sed commands to certain lines, or ranges of lines.</p>\n<p>The simplest address is a single number that limits sed commands to the given line number:</p>\n<pre>\nsed '5s/foo/bar/'\n</pre>\n<p>This limits the <code>s/foo/bar/</code> only to the 5th line of file or input stream. So if there is a \"<code>foo</code>\" on the 5th line, it will be replaced with \"<code>bar</code>\". No other lines will be touched.</p>\n<p>The addresses can be also inverted with the <code>!</code> after the address. To match all lines that are not the 5th line (lines 1-4, plus lines 6-...), do this:</p>\n<pre>\nsed '5!s/foo/bar/'\n</pre>\n<p>The inversion can be applied to any address.</p>\n<p>Next, you can also limit sed commands to a range of lines by specifying two numbers, separated by a comma:</p>\n<pre>\nsed '5,10s/foo/bar/'\n</pre>\n<p>In this one-liner the <code>s/foo/bar/</code> is executed only on lines 5 - 10, inclusive. Here is a quick, useful one-liner. Suppose you want to print lines 5 - 10 in the file. You can first disable implicit line printing with the <code>-n</code> command line switch, and then use the <code>p</code> command on lines 5 - 10:</p>\n<pre>\nsed -n '5,10p'\n</pre>\n<p>This will execute the <code>p</code> command only on lines 5 - 10. No other lines will be output. Pretty neat, isn't it?</p>\n<p>There is a special address <code>$</code> that matches the last line of the file. Here is an example that prints the last line of the file:</p>\n<pre>\nsed -n '$p'\n</pre>\n<p>As you can see, the <code>p</code> command has been limited to <code>$</code>, which is the last line of input.</p>\n<p>Next, there is also a single regular expression address match like this <code>/regex/</code>. If you specify a regex before a command, then the command will only get executed on lines that match the regex. Check this out:</p>\n<pre>\nsed -n '/a\\+b\\+/p'\n</pre>\n<p>Here the <code>p</code> command will get called only on lines that match <code>a\\+b\\+</code> regular expression, which means one or more letters \"<code>a</code>\" followed by one or more letters \"<code>b</code>\". For example, it prints lines like \"<code>ab</code>\", \"<code>aab</code>\", \"<code>aaabbbbb</code>\", \"<code>foo-123-ab</code>\", etc. Note how the <code>+</code> has to be escaped. That's because sed uses basic regular expressions by default. You can enable extended regular expressions by using the <code>-r</code> command line switch:</p>\n<pre>\nsed -rn '/a+b+/p'\n</pre>\n<p>This way you don't need to quote meta-characters like <code>+</code>, <code>(</code> and <code>)</code>.</p>\n<p>There is also an expression to match a range between two regexes. Here is an example,</p>\n<pre>\nsed '/foo/,/bar/d'\n</pre>\n<p>This one-liner matches all lines between the first line that matches \"<code>/foo/</code>\" regex and the first line that matches \"<code>/bar/</code>\" regex, inclusive. It applies the <code>d</code> command that stands for delete. In other words, it deletes a range of lines between the first line that matches \"<code>/foo/</code>\" and the first line after \"<code>/foo/</code>\" that matches \"<code>/bar/</code>\", inclusive.</p>\n<p>Now let's take a look at the hold buffer. Suppose you have a problem where you want to print the line before the line that matches a regular expression. How do you do this? If sed didn't have a hold buffer, things would be tough, but with hold buffer we can always save the current line to the hold buffer, and then let sed read in the next line. Now if the next line matches the regex, we would just print the hold buffer, which holds the previous line. Easy, right?</p>\n<p>The command for copying the current pattern space to the hold buffer is <code>h</code>. The command for copying the hold buffer back to the pattern space is <code>g</code>. The command for exchanging the hold buffer and the pattern space is <code>x</code>. We just have to choose the right commands to solve this problem. Here is the solution:</p>\n<pre>\nsed -n '/regex/{x;p;x}; h'\n</pre>\n<p>It works this way - every line gets copied to the hold buffer with the <code>h</code> command at the end of the script. However, for every line that matches the <code>/regex/</code>, we exchange the hold buffer with the pattern space by using the <code>x</code> command, print it with the <code>p</code> command, and then exchange the buffers back, so that if the next line matches the <code>/regex/</code> again, we could print the current line.</p>\n<p>Also notice the command grouping. Several commands can be grouped and executed only for a specific address or range. In this one-liner the command group is <code>{x;p;x}</code> and it gets executed only if the current line matches <code>/regex/</code>.</p>\n<p>Note that this one-liner doesn't work if it's the first line of the input matches <code>/regex/</code>. To fix this, we can limit the <code>p</code> command to all lines that are not the first line with the <code>1!</code> inverted address match:</p>\n<pre>\nsed -n '/regex/{x;1!p;x}; h'\n</pre>\n<p>Notice the <code>1!p</code>. This says - call the <code>p</code> command on all the lines that are not the 1st line. This prevents anything to be printed in case the first line matches <code>/regex/</code>.</p>\n<p>Well, that's it! I think this introduction explains the most important concepts in sed, including various command line switches, the four spaces and various sed commands.</p>\n<p>If you wish to learn more, I suggest you get a copy of my \"<a href=\"http://www.catonmat.net/blog/sed-book/\">Sed One-Liners Explained</a>\" e-book. The e-book contains exactly 100 well-explained one-liners. Once you work through them, you'll have rewired your brain to \"think in sed\". In other words, you'll have learned how to manipulate the pattern space, the hold buffer and you'll know when to print the data to get the results that you need.</p>\n<div><p><a href=\"http://www.catonmat.net/blog/sed-book/\" title=\"Sed One-Liners Explained\"><img src=\"http://www.catonmat.net/images/sed-book/cover.png\"></a><br>\n<small><a href=\"http://www.catonmat.net/blog/sed-book/\">sed book</a></small></p>\n</div>\n<p>Have fun!</p>\n<p>If you enjoy my writing, you can <a href=\"http://www.catonmat.net/feed/\">subscribe</a> to my blog, follow me on <a href=\"http://twitter.com/pkrumins\">Twitter</a> or <strong><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/102155999275405024037\"><span style=\"color:blue\">G</span><span style=\"color:red\">o</span><span style=\"color:#ee9a00\">o</span><span style=\"color:blue\">g</span><span style=\"color:green\">l</span><span style=\"color:red\">e</span><span style=\"color:gray\">+</span></a></strong>.</p>\n<div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/catonmat?a=QdjwFtz3_n8:hKNWHNpAQGE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/catonmat?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/catonmat?a=QdjwFtz3_n8:hKNWHNpAQGE:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/catonmat?i=QdjwFtz3_n8:hKNWHNpAQGE:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/catonmat?a=QdjwFtz3_n8:hKNWHNpAQGE:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/catonmat?i=QdjwFtz3_n8:hKNWHNpAQGE:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/catonmat?a=QdjwFtz3_n8:hKNWHNpAQGE:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/catonmat?i=QdjwFtz3_n8:hKNWHNpAQGE:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/catonmat/~4/QdjwFtz3_n8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

It’s not really all that harmful, but there that ugly flashing of everything that goes on as all the windows are unreparented, reparented, unredirected and redirected. This doesn’t just happen in cases where you are restarting your window manager, it also happens on login and logout too.</p>\n<p>It’s 2011, there’s no reason why we should have to put up with this anymore, especially if today’s hardware and hardware from 6 years ago is more than capable of always compositing. The question is how to handle the movements between compositors. It doesn’t make any sense to use compiz for lightdm/gdm/kdm or when you are logging out. However it does make sense to use a lightweight compositor which can hold the image of your screen in place. With compositing happening all the way, it should be possible to have a way for each compositor to hand-off to each other such that the user never sees a flicker as windows are redirected and unredirected.</p>\n<p>This is where the proposed <strong>_NET_CM_HANDOFF</strong> specification comes into place. It provides a very rudimentary protocol for compositors to handle management and unmanagement while ensuring that the user doesn’t see what’s going on, so all the user sees is a brief freeze of their screen as the new compositor takes over from the old one. For example:</p>\n<span><a href=\"http://smspillaz.wordpress.com/2011/10/08/flicker-free-compositor-replaces/\"><img src=\"http://img.youtube.com/vi/P8Dsy3UOfZQ/2.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></span>\n<p>In that example, the compositor is actually being completely restarted, but the old compositor stays around just long enough to ensure that the new compositor can take over from where it left off. This will be useful in the case of, eg, login, where lightdm can implement a simple compositor and compiz can take over from lightdm when it is ready to draw and smoothly fade-through or even have a cube-effect or something like that to signify that the login is done.</p>\n<p>Just a nice touch for a day’s worth of hacking <img src=\"http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\"> </p>\n<p><strong>edit:</strong> totally forgot about the code: https://code.launchpad.net/~smspillaz/+junk/handoff</p>\n<br>  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/smspillaz.wordpress.com/838/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/smspillaz.wordpress.com/838/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/smspillaz.wordpress.com/838/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/delicious/smspillaz.wordpress.com/838/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gofacebook/smspillaz.wordpress.com/838/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/facebook/smspillaz.wordpress.com/838/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gotwitter/smspillaz.wordpress.com/838/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/twitter/smspillaz.wordpress.com/838/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/smspillaz.wordpress.com/838/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/stumble/smspillaz.wordpress.com/838/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/smspillaz.wordpress.com/838/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/digg/smspillaz.wordpress.com/838/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/smspillaz.wordpress.com/838/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/reddit/smspillaz.wordpress.com/838/\"></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=smspillaz.wordpress.com&amp;blog=1094742&amp;post=838&amp;subd=smspillaz&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">"

This is no small task, to be\nsure; even getting flicker-free transitions between plymouth and X for\nthe KMS-capable video cards was a handful for 10.04 LTS.</p>\n\n<p>So I was suitably impressed when in the course of testing for the\nupcoming <a href=\"http://www.thisisthecountdown.com/\">Ubuntu 11.10 release</a> I\nfound that on a laptop with the nouveau driver, we had achieved 100%\nflicker-free boot all the way from grub to X.  And then I was astonished\nto find the grub-kernel transition was flicker-free when using the\n<em>binary nvidia driver</em> too!</p>\n\n<p>This is in large part thanks to Colin Watson's work upstream\nimplementing VBE support in GRUB2, and Andy Whitcroft's adding proper\nsupport for a vesafb fallback when no KMS video driver is found.  The\narchitecture of how this all hangs together is now documented in the\n<a href=\"https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BootGraphicsArchitecture\">Ubuntu wiki</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The irony is that, while nouveau gives a perfect flicker-free boot, and\nthe nvidia binary drivers give a boot with just one modeswitch, both of my\nIntel systems show <em>two</em> modeswitches on boot - one between grub and the\nkernel, another between the kernel and X.  Something to work on cleaning up\nnext month, I think...</p>"

Doua de cate ~200 EUR catre EUROSTAR, una de vreo 70 EUR catre SNCF (aparent, cineva vrea sa se plimbe cu trenul pe banii mei). M-am dus la cel mai apropiat oficiu ING (de la ei am card), sperand ca gasesc pe cineva, dar cum tocmai inchisese, am sunat la hotline, am blocat cardul si am reclamat tranzactiile.</p>\n<p>Motivul pentru care stau relativ linistit e ca &quot;grosul&quot; banilor (valoarea mea, valoarea mea...) stau pe alt cont, cu alt card, pe care stiu SIGUR ca l-am folosit doar in locuri in care am avut perfecta incredere: bancomatele ING si alte bancomate care mi s-au parut suficient de secure (da, eu sunt de-ala care trage de slotul de card sa verifice de skimmere), respectiv amazon si paypal, singurii procesatori online in care am avut incredere; da, inclusiv la ePayment foloseam tot asta &quot;insecure&quot; <img alt=\":P\" src=\"http://blog.technostoic.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\"> </p>\n<p>E foarte posibil ca contul sa fi fost compromis mai de mult, pentru ca de obicei tin sub 100$ pe el, insa luna asta a trebuit sa fac rezervari de hotel si mutasem aici in cazul in care voiau sa blocheze banii.</p>\n<p>In plus, banca imi ofera un serviciu de monitorizare SMS a tranzactiilor: pentru orice tranzactie mai mare de un anumit prag (momentan 200 RON), sunt alertat imediat pe SMS. Asa pot sta linistit ca vad imediat ce ies banii din cont.</p>\n<p>Ce se intampla mai departe? Maine ma voi duce sa depun plangere oficiala la politie, la Brigada de Combatere a Criminalitatii Organizate, dupa care imi voi emite  alt card (tot imi expirau cardurile luna viitoare). Inteleg ca in functie de cat de cooperanta e banca catre care s-a facut plata, pot debloca banii respectivi in maxim 60 de zile.</p>\n<p>Ce concluzii personale am tras? In primul rand, practica cardului separat s-a dovedit foarte practica si o sa o aplic mai cu strictete (o sa incerc sa folosesc noul card exclusiv la bancomate ING). In al doilea rand, serviciul ala de monitorizare SMS isi merita pe deplin cei 2-3$ pe care ii platesc suplimentar in fiecare luna. In al treilea rand, va trebui sa fiu mult mai strict cu sumele pe care le tin pe cardul ala (desi daca stau sa ma gandesc, n-ar strica sa tin niste bani &quot;de sacrificiu&quot; ca sa poata fi prinsa tranzactia neautorizata, nu refuzata din lipsa de bani).</p>\n<p>Asta dupa o zi in care am rescris niste checkuri de Nagios.

Thanks to Zugschlus (Marc Haber) I got 1g ram for both machines\ngoing to Vienna (one buildd, one porter box), and thanks to Robert Grimm\na 160g harddisk to replace the build-in 40g in the porter box (the buildd\ncan cope with 40g fine).

A tagline of “An ARM Linux box for $25. Take a byte!” sums it up rather nicely and should get many a geeks pulse racing. The <a href=\"http://wiki.maemo.org/Mer\">Mer</a> community have been good about getting Qt up and running on the Raspberry PI and we appreciate their drive and rapid work. We will now proceed to document how to build Qt in order to have full OpenGL ES 2 (tested) and OpenVG support (untested)</p>\n<p>The mkspecs are <a href=\"https://gitorious.org/qt-platform-mkspecs\">here</a> with associated <a href=\"https://gitorious.org/qt-platform-mkspecs/qt-platform-mkspecs/blobs/master/5.0/linux-rasp-pi-g++/patches/0001-EGLFS-changes-required-for-BCM-Raspberry-pi.patch\">patch(es)</a>.<br>\nThe modified simplegl driver (required for QWS support in Qt 4.8) is <a href=\"https://qt.gitorious.org/qt-labs/simplegl\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>I have tested Qt 4.8 QWS with the simplegl driver, Qt 4.8 QPA (lighthouse) trunk with the EGLFS driver and Qt 5 trunk with the EGLFS driver. We are looking great on all fronts. (Videos to follow, but the performance is great at 1360×768) The required changes were a couple lines of Broadcom specific initialization code which is added to the simplegl connect method and the QEglFSScreen constructor respectively for QWS/QPA.</p>\n<p>We clearly can’t distribute the libraries/headers the above mkspecs reference. (Qt Embedded/QPA are both largely self contained and only require external headers/libs for EGL/GLES2/OpenVG support)</p>\n<p>I am using the Code Sourcery 2010q1 compiler.<br>\nI am using a sd-card (read snapshot) with all the required libraries (and the EGL/GLES2/VG headers required to compile Qt)</p>\n<p>I was happy to see how easy it was to get Qt 5 cross compiled and running on the device. I restricted my build efforts to qtbase and qtdeclarative, but this built rapidly and without fault.</p>\n<p><strong>Caveat</strong>!: Before proceeding, my instructions are home brewed, pragmatic and get the job done. If you have better/functional instructions on getting the Qt 5 repo to a buildable state, then please don’t walk off a cliff with me.</p>\n<p><strong>Checking out Qt 5:<br>\n</strong><br>\ngit clone git://gitorious.org/qt/qt5.git<br>\n./init-repository<br>\n./qtrepotools/bin/qt5_tool -p</p>\n<p>The implications of this are covered in the <a href=\"https://qt.gitorious.org/qt/qt5/blobs/master/README\">README</a></p>\n<p><strong>Proceeding with the build<br>\n</strong></p>\n<p>Having symlinked in the appropriate mkspec from the git repo above and abstracting away my personal path arrangements, my configure line follows:</p>\n<p>/opt/dev/src/qt5/qtbase/configure -prefix /opt/dev/qt-qpa-5-rasp-pi -release -no-phonon -no-qt3support -no-webkit -make libs -armfpa -arch armv6 -xplatform linux-rasp-pi-g++ -opengl es2 -confirm-license</p>\n<p>Once this was built and you have your trusty qt 5 relevant qmake, creating a qtdeclarative directory within your shadow built qt, and running:</p>\n<p>qmake /opt/dev/src/qt5/qtdeclarative/qtdeclarative.pro<br>\nmake<br>\nmake install</p>\n<p>Gets you <a href=\"http://doc.qt.nokia.com/qt5-snapshot/qtquick2-whatsnew.html\">Qt Quick 2</a> (Scenegraph) enriched and merrily on your road to riches.</p>\n<p><strong>What remains to be done:<br>\n</strong><br>\n1) The device has OpenMax support which we could use for Audio/Video/Image decoding. It would be nice to see whether we can utilize this in Qt’s image loading plugin mechanism.<br>\n2) Get qtwebkit compiled, deployed and running on the target (Python related hijinxs stemming from the build-webkit script postponed inclusion in the done list above)<br>\n3) Turtles the whole way down (There is no shortage of board specific customization we could potentially indulge in)</p>\n<p>I look forward to the deluge of videos showing the capabilities of accelerated Qt (4 or 5) on this fine hardware. We will be demoing this device in the demo pavilion at this year’s <a href=\"http://qt.nokia.com/qtdevdays2011/\">Qt Developer Day</a> event in Munich and San Francisco and I will personally be on hand to answer any posting/cross compilation questions you may happen to have.</p>"

      "content" : "Microsoft have <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/b8/archive/2011/09/22/protecting-the-pre-os-environment-with-uefi.aspx\">responded</a> to suggestions that Windows 8 may make it difficult to boot alternative operating systems. What's interesting is that at no point do they contradict anything I've said. As things stand, Windows 8 certified systems will make it either more difficult or impossible to install alternative operating systems. But let's have some more background.<br><br>We became aware of this issue in early August. Since then, we at Red Hat have been discussing the problem with other Linux vendors, hardware vendors and BIOS vendors. We've been making sure that we understood the ramifications of the policy in order to avoid saying anything that wasn't backed up by facts. These are the facts:<ul><br><li>Windows 8 certification requires that hardware ship with UEFI secure boot enabled.<br></li><li>Windows 8 certification does not require that the user be able to disable UEFI secure boot, and we've already been informed by hardware vendors that some hardware will not have this option.<br></li><li>Windows 8 certification does not require that the system ship with any keys other than Microsoft's.<br></li><li>A system that ships with UEFI secure boot enabled and only includes Microsoft's signing keys will only securely boot Microsoft operating systems.</li></ul><br>Microsoft have a dominant position in the desktop operating system market. Despite Apple's huge comeback over the past decade, their worldwide share of the desktop market is <a href=\"http://www.gartner.com/it/page.jsp?id=1744216\">below 5%</a>. Linux is far below that. Microsoft own well over 90% of the market. Competition in that market is tough, and vendors will take every break they can get. That includes the Windows logo program, in which Microsoft give incentives to vendors to sell hardware that meets their certification requirements. Vendors who choose not to follow the certification requirements will be at a disadvantage in the marketplace. So while it's up to vendors to choose whether or not to follow the certification requirements, Microsoft's dominant position means that they'd be losing sales by doing so.<br><br>Why is this a problem? Because there's no central certification authority for UEFI signing keys. Microsoft can require that hardware vendors include their keys. Their competition can't. A system that ships with Microsoft's signing keys and no others will be unable to perform secure boot of any operating system other than Microsoft's. No other vendor has the same position of power over the hardware vendors. Red Hat is unable to ensure that every OEM carries their signing key. Nor is Canonical. Nor is Nvidia, or AMD or any other PC component manufacturer. Microsoft's influence here is greater than even Intel's. <br><br>What does this mean for the end user? Microsoft claim that the customer is in control of their PC. That's true, if by \"customer\" they mean \"hardware manufacturer\". The end user is not guaranteed the ability to install extra signing keys in order to securely boot the operating system of their choice. The end user is not guaranteed the ability to disable this functionality. The end user is not guaranteed that their system will include the signing keys that would be required for them to swap their graphics card for one from another vendor, or replace their network card and still be able to netboot, or install a newer SATA controller and have it recognise their hard drive in the firmware. The end user is no longer in control of their PC.<br><br>If Microsoft were serious about giving the end user control, they'd be mandating that systems ship without any keys installed. The user would then have the ability to make an informed and conscious decision to limit the flexibility of their system and install the keys. The user would be told what they'd be gaining and what they'd be giving up.<br><br>The final irony? If the user has no control over the installed keys, the user has no way to indicate that they don't trust Microsoft products. They can prevent their system booting malware. They can prevent their system booting Red Hat, Ubuntu, FreeBSD, OS X or any other operating system. But they can't prevent their system from running Windows 8.<br><br>Microsoft's rebuttal is entirely factually accurate. But it's also misleading. The truth is that Microsoft's move removes control from the end user and places it in the hands of Microsoft and the hardware vendors. The truth is that it makes it more difficult to run anything other than Windows. The truth is that UEFI secure boot is a valuable and worthwhile feature that Microsoft are misusing to gain tighter control over the market. And the truth is that Microsoft haven't even attempted to argue otherwise.<br><br><img alt=\"comment count unavailable\" height=\"12\" src=\"http://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=mjg59&amp;ditemid=5850\" style=\"vertical-align:middle\" width=\"30\"> comments"

      "content" : "<p><img src=\"http://torrentfreak.com/images/trial-pig.jpg\" align=\"right\" alt=\"trial\">In the Middle Ages, there were sometimes two sets of justice systems. </p>\n<p>A “high court” for nobility, where people would be sentenced to pay a fine, issue a formal apology, or to lead armies into would-be colonies for ten years and return as rich as dragons. And a “low court” for the common folk, where people would be sentenced to branding, have their hands cut off, or sometimes just thrown in jail if it was a petty offense; like killing another commoner, which was a lesser offense than stealing from merchants.</p>\n<p>When I grew up, school taught me that democracies in the West are proud of how everybody is equal before the law. It was not until I became a full-time politician that I realized what a joke this is.</p>\n<p>In reality, the high courts and low courts have been reintroduced in silence. When Sony BMG <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_Sony_BMG_CD_copy_protection_scandal\">broke into</a> millions of computers worldwide in 2005, rootkitting them to disable their ability to run instructions that would violate Sony’s own interpretation of its copyright monopoly, Sony was sentenced to send out marketing material for its own products and no individual executives were charged. When LulzSec members were arrested for breaking into systems in the singular, they get the low court treatment.</p>\n<p>When a commoner is accused of violating the copyright monopoly, in some draconian countries like France, they can be sent into social exile without even getting a trial in the low court. In contrast, the noble Voddler (a video-on-demand service) violated the GPL <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voddler#GPL_violation_controversy\">egregiously</a> by using free software to build its service — but without resharing the code, thus violating the copyright monopoly that GPL builds on, and for thoroughly commercial purposes. They were never prosecuted. In contrast, they are now speaking at hearings in parliaments on how successful they are.</p>\n<p>As a politician, <strong>I have learned that the rights of the commoners are never enforced against the noble, but that the monopolies of the noble are always enforced against commoners.</strong> This is not being equal before the law. When did this division of people happen? How did some become more equal than others?</p>\n<p>And don’t get me started on how the copyright nobility sat at the tables of the ACTA drafting, but where the rest of us creators — who only hold just as strong monopolies in theory — were mere commoners who should not interfere with the regulations of the monopoly on truth and culture.</p>\n<p>There are many more examples. In Sweden and several other countries, commoners have to pay a fee to the copyright nobility just to play their own music — as in their singlehandedly composed and performed music — in their own hair styling salon.</p>\n<p>This is just a symptom. The high and low courts go well beyond the scope of the copyright monopoly.</p>\n<p>Isn’t it about time we <strong>reconquered</strong> democracy and <strong>abolished</strong> the high and low courts? <strong>Again?</strong></p>\n<div style=\"border:2px solid #3f3f3f;width:521px;padding:15px;padding-top:8px;padding-bottom:4px;margin-top:20px;margin-bottom:10px;border-radius:10px\">\n<h3 style=\"margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:10px\">\n<div style=\"float:right;height:130px;width:39px;margin-left:20px;margin-right:10px\"><img src=\"http://falkvinge.net/wp-content/themes/WpNewspaper/images/falkvinge/Rick_Falkvinge_39x130.jpg\" style=\"border:none\"></div>\n<p><span style=\"color:#3f3f3f;font-size:125%\">About The</span> <span style=\"color:#ff3c78;font-size:125%\">Author</span></p>\n</h3>\n<p style=\"font-family:PTSansRegular,Arial,Sans-Serif;font-weight:400;line-height:150%;margin-bottom:14px\"><small>Rick Falkvinge is a regular columnist on TorrentFreak, sharing his thoughts every other week.

      "content" : "<img src=\"http://planet.debian.org/heads/timo.png\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" alt=\"\" align=\"right\" style=\"float:right\">  The MeeGo community is frustrated with the news of the MeeGo brand being abandoned. Some are understandably angry or otherwise not happy about how Linux Foundation, Intel handled the <a href=\"https://www.tizen.org/\">Tizen</a> announcement and community in general - or more like how they didn't handle it at all.Last week <a href=\"http://openmind.fi/\">Openmind 2011</a> happened to be arranged in Tampere on the very same day as Tizen announcement came alive. It was good in the way that it lead to the fact that <a href=\"http://nomovok.com/\">Nomovok</a>'s CEO Pasi Nieminen was able to initiate the \"<a href=\"http://meegonetwork.fi/node/456\">Reigniting MeeGo</a>\" session not just by talking vague things about future, but actually about the process which led to Tizen and the unfortunately brief initial PR about it. Pasi is intense on emphasizing the quality and role of <a href=\"http://labs.qt.nokia.com/2011/09/12/qt-project/\">Qt</a> in Tizen as well, even though officially Tizen is all about HTML5 and apparently from Samsung's part at least EFL is provided as a native toolkit. However, the promise of Tizen compared to MeeGo is reportedly that the toolkit is not specified in compliancy documents, so HTML5 with WAC is the main/only \"3rd party apps\" layer whereas others can be offered case-by-case. This means that unlike before, the underlying system can be built on top of practically any distribution (theoretically) and using whatever toolkits and other techniques wanted. Obviously the \"<a href=\"http://nomovok.com/news/57/73/Nordic-System-Integrators-Welcome-Open-Source-Initiative-Tizen\">Nordic System Integrators</a>\" are probably all very keen of using Qt to produce more of <a href=\"http://swipe.nokia.com/\">Nokia N9</a> quality user experiences in various products.<br><br>Taking the corporate hat off, I as a community member am also puzzled. The only reason I was not completely blown by the news was that I didn't yet manage to get involved in MeeGo community on a daily basis, since I'm involved with a dozen communities already. Instead I've been more like scratching the surface with MeeGo Network Finland meetings, IRC activity, OBS usage for building a few apps for MeeGo Harmattan and MeeGo proper etc. But I can somewhat understand how people like Jarkko Moilanen from meego-fi feel. They have given a _lot_ to the MeeGo community and brand, all taken away without hearing or pre-notice.<br><br>So where to now for MeeGo community? Tizen is one obvious choice. However, for all the talks that even I started this post with, Tizen is still vaporware today, and the dislike of how community is being treated might make it easy to consider other options. Also, if Tizen's reference implementation has lesser meaning, it might also mean less to actually be \"in\" the Tizen community than in MeeGo. I met Jos Poortvliet at Openmind, and he <a href=\"http://blog.jospoortvliet.com/2011/09/meego-and-opensuse-invitation.html\">invited people to openSUSE</a>. There is a lot of common ground with MeeGo and openSUSE - strong OBS usage, RPM packaging, community side focused on KDE and therefore Qt.<br><br>I would like to now point similarly to <a href=\"http://www.debian.org/\">Debian</a>! If one is tired about corporate interests and not listening to community, there is no match for Debian's 15+ years history, purely volunteer based, trust based organization, and first of all scope. While openSUSE has traditionally focused on desktop (even though like Jos pointed out they are open to all new contributions and projects), Debian has always had the \"universal\" scope, ie. no boundaries besides producing free software operating system for various purposes. There are over 10 architectures maintained at the moment, including the ARM (different ports for ARMv4 and hard-float ARMv7) and x86 from MeeGo world. There are even alternative kernels to Linux, mainly the GNU/kFreeBSD port. There are multiple relevant plans and projects like the <a href=\"http://wiki.debian.org/Smartphone\">Smartphones</a> wiki area, most noticeably <a href=\"http://wiki.debian.org/DebianOnFreeRunner\">Debian on Neo FreeRunner</a>. I have run <a href=\"http://losca.blogspot.com/2011/04/tuning-old-but-free-phone-video-now.html\">Debian on my primary mobile</a> phone for over 2.5 years, although now in the recent months I've had dual-SIM in my Nokia N950 as well (Debian not yet running on Nokia N950 or Nokia N9 - but it can and will be done!).<br><br>What Debian may lack in both good and bad is corporate funding, if you don't count the still quite respectful contributions from Ubuntu to Debian (it's in Ubuntu's interests to contribute as much possible back to Debian, so that the delta remains small). For each and every aspect, it needs a volunteer - there are a thousand volunteer Debian Developers, and at least a double of that of people without the official DD status but who still maintain a package or two among the 25000+ packages in Debian. That means also that one my find it more lucrative to join a project that has paid people to do some of the \"boring parts\", more of fancy web tools, including for bug handling and build systems like the OBS (which I do love by the way). On the other hand, there is no other project in my opinion where what you do really matters as much.<br><br>To find out more about Debian from MeeGo perspective, please see the recent mailing list post <a href=\"http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2011/09/msg00126.html\">Mobile UXes - From the DebConf11 BoF to the stars</a> where I wrote most of the MeeGo (CE) part when I was asked to and known of my MeeGo involvement.<br><br>Last but not certainly least, there is the <a href=\"http://mer-project.org/\">Mer project</a> - originally \"maemo reconstructed\", ie. making Nokia's \"not really distro\" into a real distro by filling in the void places. Now it's obviously MeeGo reconstructed, and they aim to be <a href=\"http://lists.meego.com/pipermail/meego-dev/2011-October/484215.html\">the MeeGo they always wanted MeeGo to be</a>! Read the post for details from Carsten Munk and other key Mer people. They share the love for Qt, and want the core to be as lean as possible. They also aim to incorporate the most community like aspect from MeeGo - <a href=\"http://losca.blogspot.com/2011/08/meego-ce-and-freesmartphoneorg.html\">MeeGo CE</a> - as the reference vendor in Mer. They also aim to be Tizen compliant - and when Tizen comes alive, I wouldn't see why the Tizen reference implementation couldn't be used for saving resources. Maybe Nomovok and/or others could offer the Qt maintaining part.<br><br>So, it might be that Tizen itself is enough for most people's needs. The key point however in this post is not to fall in agony if one corporate based project takes big turns - it has happened before, it will happen in the future. There are always enough political and business reasons from some points of view to do Big Changes. But the wider community is out there, always, and it's bigger than you think. You should consider where you want to contribute by asking yourself why you are/were part of for example the MeeGo community. Aaron Seigo from KDE asked us all this question in the Openmind MeeGo Reignited session, and I think it's good to repeat.<div><img src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/31939153-3673721401886849256?l=losca.blogspot.com\" alt=\"\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"></div>"

      "content" : "<img src=\"http://planet.debian.org/heads/codehelp.png\" width=\"85\" height=\"113\" alt=\"\" align=\"right\" style=\"float:right\">  A continuation of my <a href=\"http://www.linux.codehelp.co.uk/serendipity/index.php?/archives/217-Documenting-Emdebian-intro.html\">intermittent series on Emdebian</a> and prompted by a query from <a href=\"http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2011/09/msg00328.html\">Paul Wise</a>, I thought I'd cover some of the uses to which a device running Emdebian can be put. It is a bit long this one...<br>\n<br>\nSo, yes, there are general purpose computers which could run Emdebian but there are common features amongst general purpose computers:<br>\n<ol><li><p><b>Lots of different tasks must be supported</b> - lots of different packages installed, each user could quite easily use a distinct set of packages from another user.</p><p></p></li><br>\n<li><p><b>Multi-user support</b> - even if any one machine is only used by one person, a general purpose computer must have support for adding another user - not just a system user, a real user with a login, shell, possibly bookmarks and browser history etc.</p></li><br>\n<li><p><b>Connectivity</b> - general purpose computers (and that includes mobile phones) <b>must</b> connect to a variety of other computers to be at all useful.</p></li><br>\n<li><p><b>Multi-modal data input</b> - there needs to be support for a mouse and a keyboard or touchscreen and just as likely, software support for accessibility interfaces like an on screen keyboard and switch inputs.</p></li><br>\n<li><p><b>Storage for user data</b> - the system admin can't know how much data users are going to add and if it is general purpose, it's probably going to support media players, image viewers, even office software. The data files managed and written by such software tend to be large and tend to accumulate into large collections. This means that a general purpose machine cannot anticipate the full storage requirements, so has to allow plenty of room for user data storage.  If there's so much storage space available, why use an OS which is primarily designed to take up less space? Just use the full version, Debian.</p></li></ol><br>\n<br>\nNow compare with the common features of special purpose or single-purpose computers:<br>\n<ol><li><p><b>Single task only</b> - a splash screen (without support for removal) covers all the boot information, the single task starts as a daemon and if the user quits the task, the task initiates a shutdown, not quit. Every effort is made to prevent the task from exposing the underlying OS, including auto-restarts if it does crash.</p></li><br>\n<li><p><b>Single-user support</b> - indeed, <i>user</i> is not the typical user. <i>user</i> in this case is a non-login user without a shell, created by the postinst of the task package purely to support running the task without root privileges (because if the task doesn't need privileges, it shouldn't retain privileges).</p></li><br>\n<li><p><b>Single mode input</b> - don't expect these machines to support 105 key keyboards. You'll be lucky to have 5 keys which are really just buttons. The button won't just enter 'J' into the machine, it will fire off a command to charge your bank or start a drill or shutdown a malfunctioning service. (Each button will often be multi-functional as well, depending on context). Some devices will replace the mouse with a touchscreen but many are fitted in places where touchscreens simply won't survive, where keys have to be able to withstand being submerged in water (or oil) for hours. Many machines simply won't have mouse support at all. Many will not have any typical external connectors. Indeed, units which go into dirty or wet environments certainly won't have standard external connectors of any kind. Think boats and factories. Internal battery packs with custom hot-fit replacements, buttons encased in 4mm of clear plastic, screens viewable only through protective mesh / filters.</p></li><br>\n<li><p><b>Restricted connectivity</b> - if the task doesn't need networking, no networking hardware is fitted. If the task doesn't need USB, no USB hardware is fitted. If the task doesn't need serial connections, there will probably be an internal serial connector but also a <b>Warranty void if removed</b> sticker. Don't expect an RS232 inside the case either, this will be a flat cable connector which you'll need to attach to a breakout board which correctly connects the cable wires to the RS232 port pins. That mapping is not standardised (why would it? only service engineers are approved to use it.)</p></li><br>\n<li><p><b>Constrained user data</b> - the task is in complete control and determines what the user can view, store and access. Storage can be expensive and a power drain, so if the task doesn't need Gb of storage, don't fit the machine with Gb of storage. Profit.</p></li></ol><br>\n<br>\nSo what are these mysterious single-use computers running Emdebian? It's hard to tell because the task has no particular reason to tell the user anything about the OS. Perhaps a different way to phrase the same question would be: <b>Why use a general purpose OS for a special purpose computer?</b>.<br>\n<ul><li><p><b>Single task does not mean single process</b> - doing one thing can involve doing a couple of different things behind the scenes, so a multi-tasking kernel and userspace is extremely useful in providing a <i>responsive</i> machine without wasting money on unnecessarily powerful hardware. Multithreading support is also valuable.</p></li><br>\n<li><p><b>Software reuse makes good business sense</b> - why write a single-usage operating system when the device needs a multi-tasking OS anyway and suitable ones already exist?</p></li><br>\n<li><p><b>Minimal software</b> - no point packaging Xorg or GNOME when the user interface is a tiny QVGA framebuffer and the device only has 128Mb of RAM. By all means get the core system (cairo, pango, Qt, gettext, dpkg) from Emdebian but the actual code which performs the task of the device will generally be bespoke and, yes, that generally means proprietary, closed source, utterly non-free. This is where GNU/Linux wins over iOS and Windows - the graphical software is <b>trivially</b> separated from the core software and tested as such. If your device has only monochrome text output (and plenty of those still exist), what possible reason is there to use a graphical toolkit? Use the multi-tasking support of the OS to handle inter-process communication and understand the licensing - job done. Again, these devices have deliberately limited storage capacity, the smaller the OS, the lower the cost of the device, within certain constraints.</p></li><br>\n<li><p><b>Debugging compatibility</b> - <b>this is the big one</b>. It's hard debugging the task software on device with the differences in architecture and connectivity. Why not use the same packages on the same OS on the development machines as on the devices? All the power and all the screen resources to properly investigate bugs, simple way to provide an emulator for translation support and other activities (like <b>user interface training</b>). There will always be bugs which have to be debugged on device - timing issues, hardware issues - but why not make at least a proportion of the likely bugs easier to fix by using binary compatible libraries on both the big desktop machines and the small devices?</p></li></ul><br>\n<br>\nThis is why Emdebian Grip is popular for these machines - because Emdebian Grip is binary compatible with the equivalent Debian suite and when a bug appears in the high level user interface, it is much easier to debug that on the desktop than on device. Debian stable is a fantastic OS for commercial development - the stability of the OS makes detection of interface bugs much easier. It is rare that developers have to investigate whether bugs in their UI come down to a bug in the underlying OS. That saves time.<br>\n<br>\nThe machines themselves? I'm sure others can come up with other examples but these are some which come to my mind (no particular order):<br>\n<ul><li><p><b>Control interfaces</b> - solar power controllers, robot controllers - anywhere that a low power board can monitor responses from other machines and do something intelligent about reported errors. Temperature limit responses, pressure limit responses, encoding all of those in assembly or VHDL is hard, so use a system which provides for more creative result handling.</p></li><br>\n<li><p><b>Electric car charging points</b> - very simple user interface, single task which doesn't complicate things by expecting the user to tap on something to start the main application - just process the card details, charge the customer and provide power.</p></li><br>\n<li><p>Similarly<b>electronic point of sale devices</b> - EPOS. The staff on the shop floor don't want to be waiting for an X server to start up and then using a menu. The device starts up and runs one task (checking barcodes, printing labels, counting stock), if the task is shutdown, the machine shuts down.</p></li><br>\n<li><p><b>Communication aids</b> - my area, a machine which presents a simple UI on non-standard framebuffer hardware, lots of audio output but little other connectivity.  Resilience is very important, so solid state is vital but why provide more solid state storage than the device can actually needs?</p></li></ul><br>\n<br>\nAnywhere where the device simply needs to DoTheRightThing in a variety of unpredictable circumstances, you're going to need a general purpose OS to gather the data and produce the right result. Anywhere where the device has only a single task, you're going to want to not provide access to the rest of the system. There's no point providing \"general purpose access\" when the device doesn't have \"general purpose hardware\". There's no point fitting general purpose hardware if the device does not use it. That is a waste of money, a waste of resources and causes unnecessary delays if one component or other becomes unobtainable or changes behaviour. Limit your exposure to hardware bugs and get the product out to the user more quickly and more reliably, everyone is happy. Fit non-standard hardware and you can fit custom hardware which better matches the profile of the device usage - why use standard speakers capable of CD quality across a vast frequency range when the device only makes very very loud alert noises which can be done at lower sample rates and with narrow range, high amplitude, speakers.<br>\n<br>\nThere are all sorts of estimates for the number of computers now in the average Western home. It's worth noting that the vast majority of those computers are not PCs or laptops or even game consoles and routers - all instances of general purpose machines with general purpose access / connectivity. A lot of the computers in your home are embedded in machines like white goods, media controllers (set top boxes and the like). Some of these will still use low level firmware written entirely in assembly or COBOL. More complex ones already have a general purpose OS inside yet constrain that OS with a simple, user-friendly interface which is tailored to the hardware actually fitted. It might be cool to connect to your set top box over Bluetooth but really, is that actually going to sell more units? Only if there are other high-end services written for the device which the average customer won't want to see pushing up the price of the base unit. Some machines (particularly in automotive uses) will need to be using Real Time operating systems and Safety Critical operating systems but even some of those are based on general purpose systems - just old versions which have been thoroughly tested.<br>\n<br>\nFinally, consider that for a lot of these devices, the customer is not you. The customer is another business who then put the device into something else which is installed into a factory production line which produces something which goes into creating a consumer product you find in Tesco or on Amazon or bundled in with another service like your TV/broadband contract. There is absolutely no reason for these devices to provide general purpose computing to you, even if the device itself is part of something else which <b>can</b> provide such services.<br>"

Andronescu să le ofere șansa de a se prezenta direct pentru diploma de doctorat. La o adică de ce nu, dacă e vorba să sărim etape, la ce mai sunt bune examenele de la sfîrșitul anilor? La ce bun sesiune? Facem 3, 5 ani cu masterul, după care încă 5 ani pentru un doctorat… ăia sunt inutili în fața nevoii de a fi împlinit din punct de vedere social, pentru că, nu, studenții sunt debusolați dacă nu sunt încărcați cu mizerii mentale de către școli. Hai să-i punem față în față cu examenul de doctorat și să nu-l facem nici pe ăla foarte greu, că după aia surmenăm tinerii… Și pac, bagă etnobotanice, vorba tovarășei Andronescu, că deh, asta a făcut și ea înainte să dea proiecte de legi în Parlament.</p>\n<p>Să luăm lucrurile în ordine. Primele trei articole impun ca universitățile să accepte oameni care nu au capacitatea intelectuală de a lua bacalaureatul și să-i învețe materie de facultate pentru că, nu, e mai ușoară. Adică prostanul a eșuat deși a avut doi ani să învețe cît se face în două ore de curs la Analiză matematică în facultate (da, deștepților, atîta e analiza de a XI-a și a XII-a – două ore de curs de anul I la facultate), dar în mod sigur, se va mobiliza să pice cu brio examenul de Analiză de la facultate, și este întreținut în direcția asta de prea-bogatul stat român.</p>\n<p>Mai apoi, statul susține financiar școlarizarea în postliceale, deși ÎNVĂȚĂMÎNTUL OBLIGATORIU ÎN ROMÂNIA E DE 10+1 CLASE!!! Foarte tare. Sigur, o inconsistență tovărășească ce își primește aplauzele în plenul Congresului <del>PCR</del>PSD.</p>\n<p>Dar cea mai tare fază e aia de pe final. Adică statul se obligă să susțină financiar pe intrușii ăștia care au pierdut timpul toată vara prin cluburi și n-au avut chef să invețe. În schimb, dacă ești prost, tîmpit, dobitoc să-ți iei bacul și să intri la facultate, dar la secție cu plată, ghinionul tău. Mai bine picai bacul și statul te ținea în brațe etern, pentru că ești un special.</p>\n<p>Apoi, motivația e absolut delicioasă. O las pe tov. Andronescu să preia microfonul, dar o să-mi permit mici paranteze:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Modul in care au fost abordate subiectele, <strong>lipsa pregatirii corespunzatoare a cadrului general al examinarii (e primul an în care CHIAR s-au pregătit bine cei de la minister) </strong>au condus la nepromovarea examenului de bacalaureat de multi dintre elevii cotati cu rezultate profesionale bune pe parcursul anilor de liceu <strong>(pentru că testele standardizate nu-s bune, ci doar subiectivitatea profesorilor în cei patru ani de liceu e cea care ar trebui să decidă)</strong>. In absenta unor masuri de insertie pe piata muncii va creste ingrijorator de mult riscul unor derapaje de la o evolutie personala si in cariera profesionala normala <strong>(<a href=\"http://www.bzb.ro/index.php?page_name=stire_detalii&amp;id_stire=66845\">la ultimul tîrg de locuri de muncă în Brașov s-au pus la dispoziție 1262 de locuri de muncă, s-au ocupat 56</a>)</strong>. Ca urmare, initiatorii acestui act normativ considera de datoria Parlamentului sa intervina cu masuri care sa-i sprijine pe cei capabili si interesati de formarea lor profesionala <strong>(și să restabilească gloria socialismului în lume, în numele lui Marx, Lenin, Stalin și în frunte și în inimă cu tov. <del>Ceaușescu</del>Andronescu!!! care ne-a cerut cotă la numărul de absolvenți. Uraaa! Ura! Ura!)</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>O să închei, din nou, cu un citat din Funeriu, care în momentul ăsta cred că e singurul ministru care a luptat contra corupției în România:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Este o initiativa nastrusnica, iresponsabila, care evident nu va avea succes. (…) Este o initiativa fara niciun fel de corespondent nici in Europa si niciunde altundeva in lume. Face parte din ceea ce eu numesc, fara niciun fel de emotie, scolarizarea mediocritatii. (…) Denota modul si gandirea in care acest minister a fost condus, avand in vedere cine a initiat acest lucru</p></blockquote>\n<p>Pentru că am uitat să vă zic, tov. Andronescu a condus ministerul educației odată. Și iată ce boboc l-a făcut.</p>\n<p>Uraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FlyOnTheWindscreen/~4/3Cnth47v5Kc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

He has been working on implementing File Transfer support for <a href=\"http://swift.im\">Swift</a>, using the fresh Jingle XMPP protocols. I’m happy to announce that we integrated <a href=\"http://swift.im/git/swift/commit/?id=4f62e5ec4b42929fe3c1a68667e63cb1b7a35509\">Tobias’s work</a> as an experimental feature into the main Swift branch, where it will be further developed and brushed off before being enabled in our nightly builds and releases.</p>\n<p><span></span></p>\n<p>For those interested in the nitty gritty protocol details: file transfers are negotiated through the Jingle File Transfer protocol (<a href=\"http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0234.html\">XEP-0234</a>), using SOCKS5 (<a href=\"http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0260.html\">XEP-0260</a>) as the main transport, and In-Band Bytestreams (<a href=\"http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0261.html\">XEP-0261</a>) as fallback. To improve connectivity, we use both the <a href=\"http://files.dns-sd.org/draft-cheshire-nat-pmp.txt\">NAT Port Mapping Protocol</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.upnp.org/\">UPnP Internet Gateway Device protocols</a> to allow connections through most firewalls, and <a href=\"http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0065.html#mediated\">SOCKS5 relaying proxies</a> in case all else fails.  </p>\n<p>The new feature has been tested for interoperability against (slightly modified) development versions of both <a href=\"http://pidgin.im\">Pidgin</a> and <a href=\"http://gajim.org\">Gajim</a>, which, together with the Pidgin-based <a href=\"http://adium.im\">Adium</a>, cover a large XMPP user base. After both clients update their protocols to track the newly published Draft specification versions, all 3 should be able to exchange files seamlessly.</p>\n<p>What still remains to be done is lots of testing (both internal testing, user testing, reliability testing, and interop testing), bugfixing, and some refactoring here and there to clean up some of the code (which already is in very good shape). Our end goal is to reach a rock solid implementation, with a near guarantee that file exchange will always work (which experience teaches us is far from trivial).</p>\n<p>To conclude, we’ld like to thank Tobias for contributing this great new feature to Swift, for providing valuable protocol feedback to the XSF, and for laying the foundation to other exciting Jingle-based features (including voice/video conferencing).</p>"

      "content" : "<p>When I first got to know Qt, it was a cross platform tool. That was really the reason for me to start using Qt. It was a great cross platform tool. At the time, I was using a Tru64 based system with real X-terminals. You know, the ones where the screen really is a stupid terminal connected to the network. Tru64 meant a real Unix, as in non-Linux, setup alongside Alpha CPUs. Great for what the school wanted us to do, i.e. use Matlab and latex.</p>\n<p>In this setting, I wanted to program something with a user interface. My experiences from the time was GEM, from the good old Atari ST range, VisualBasic, I’ve used 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 and 6.0 – without liking a single version, and some plain win32 from C. I did try MFC a couple of times, but I never grew fond of it. So, the first thing that I tried was xlib, which isn’t fun to use. So, along came Qt (and KDE). I believe that it was Qt 1.42 or something like that. One forgets as years passes by.</p>\n<p>Qt configured and built beautifully, and the <a href=\"http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.4/tutorials-tutorial.html\">cannon tutorial</a> had me hooked. Standard widgets, custom widgets, user driven, timer driven… this toolkit could do anything. And it was easy to use.</p>\n<p>Years pass and the chronology gets mixed up. I met some fellow Qt users at QtForum. I made my way from a common user to moderator. Then, in a series of sad events, the site was sold and the old owner simply vanished from the Internet. The reaction was to start <a href=\"http://www.qtcentre.org/\">QtCentre</a> together with the rest of the moderators and build a proper community. I cannot thank Witold enough for all the energy he still puts into this site. He really should get more credit for his work. There are other people there too who work hard, but Witold has been there from day one.</p>\n<p>Qt progressed, the X11 version was GPLed. So was the OS X version. So was the win32 version. Qt 4 brought many goodies: modularization, webkit, graphicsview, model-based viewing widgets, etc. The toolkit embraced all platforms and is really a great tool for cross platform desktop development.</p>\n<p>My self, I wrote the <a href=\"http://www.digitalfanatics.org/projects/qt_tutorial/\">Independent Qt Tutorial</a> for Qt 3, then the <a href=\"http://www.apress.com/9781590598313\">Foundations of Qt Development</a> for Qt 4. I started working with Qt as my day time job. I started speaking about Qt at conferences and user group meetings. What I spoke of was the ultimate cross platform toolkit. My favorite example was that Qt tries to integrate well with Gnome – it does not even pick sides in the KDE vs Gnome competition. The whole root of Qt is its cross platform abilities, and there Qt excels.</p>\n<p><em>Then came changes. Trolltech grew. Nokia bought them. The big fish eat the small.</em></p>\n<p>With the Nokia acquisition came a great energy. Qt was put in the limelight. This was the technology that Nokia would base its future on. Developers were attracted to Qt. Qt DevDays had to move to a larger venue to fit them all in, and it still was crowded.</p>\n<p>There where some big company things going on. Name changes – Trolltech, Qt Software, Qt Development Frameworks. Anything works. For me, personally, Trolltech had charm. Bug big companies sometimes act in strange ways. They don’t always agree with themselves and they might have contradicting policies and whatnot.</p>\n<p>With Nokia came the push of Qt as a platform of its own. Qt on Harmattan/MeeGo and Qt on Symbian where all of a sudden the core focus of all Qt development. This is not surprising, given that this is where Nokia could apply Qt. The focus of Qt Developer Days changed. Out with the widgets, in with QtQuick and bling. The cross platform nature and roots of Qt where seemingly forgotten.</p>\n<p>Do not get me wrong. QtQuick is a great piece of technology and something that I use daily in my job. It helps me be real productive and saves me from writing tons of code to drive rich user experiences.</p>\n<p><em>Then came changes. The Qt strategy of Nokia was replaced with a WP7 strategy.</em></p>\n<p>Not only was WP7 the official way forward. The Qt-based N9 is not to be sold in large markets. Despite positive reviews it looks like it will be a sad tribute to what Qt and QtQuick can do. The question is, who will pick up the ball again? Will there ever be another MeeGo handset? Most likely not, as Intel just pulled out of MeeGo, or just renamed it Tizen. The focus seems to have shifted from QtQuick to HTML5. The big question at the time of writing is what will be the underlaying engine. I’m sure everyone agrees that it will be WebKit, but will it be hosted by Qt or something else?</p>\n<p>But now Qt has started to find its roots again. Lighthouse made porting easy. <a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/p/necessitas/home/necessitas/\">Necessitas</a> puts Qt on Android. <a href=\"http://labs.qt.nokia.com/2011/08/09/update-on-uikit-lighthouse-platform/\">Qt for iOS</a> is an ongoing community port. Qt will once again excel as the cross platform solution of choice. The question here is if it is wise to merge the desktops into the QtQuick API. I’m not convinced yet. Being cross platform on desktop also means integrating with the desktops. Current desktops are widget based, and to be true, widgets rock on desktop things. When controlling a machine or writing a mail I don’t want bling, I want predictable, stable widgets that looks like they are supposed to.</p>\n<p>Compare this to common device user interfaces. Here there is a difference between applications such as mail and todo apps. Here you want common components that integrate with the platform – much like widgets. These elements usually fit into the limitations of widgets as well. Square, non-overlapping, etc.</p>\n<p>Then you have completely custom applications, think Angry Birds, where QtQuick is the ultimate tool. As QtQuick can encapsulate both these user interfaces, it is the ideal tool for this type of device user interfaces.</p>\n<p>And the current hype – HTML5? I believe that QtWebkit is the best system for building hybrid web/native applications out there. And integrating QObjects with the JavaScript space much resembles integrating them into QML space.</p>\n<p><em>After chaos; Metamorphosis</em></p>\n<p>I look forward to a new spring for Qt. Having a common Qt core for all applications. QtQuick for device user interfaces and QtWidgets for desktop. The QObject model that we have learned to love and the power of C++ will be available to all. Still, the user interface can be integrated with the platform of choice or fully customized with QtQuick. Code less, create more, deploy everywhere.</p>"

The w meant it was for wide characters. So anything that uses ncurses needs to decide which one to link to or perhaps both. A <a href=\"http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=602720\" title=\"Bug #602720\">problem</a> came up with the <a href=\"http://tiswww.tis.case.edu/%7Echet/readline/rltop.html\" rel=\"homepage\" title=\"GNU readline\">readline</a> library that needs to link to ncurses because programs that link to IT (such as python) want a wide library but other programs do not. One solution is to have two readline libraries, but then any other library would need to be compiled and built twice as well and so on and so on.</p>\n\n<p>readline didn’t really want the full ncurses library, it only wants the terminfo part but there was (until now) no way of picking up that bit only.  Once this new version of ncurses gets released then readline can link to libterminfo which is agnostic to wide and non-wide characters which means it is as well which them means everything else should, in theory work.  If you are using ncurses for some low-level terminfo work only, you may want to have a look to see if you can link to libtinfo5 only which will mean depending on libtinfo5 and not libncurses5 or libncursesw5.</p>\n\n<p>I’m just writing this up mainly and uploading the packages, the bulk of the work was done by Sven and Matthias as well as some help from our ever-helpful upstream Thomas.</p>\n\n<p> \n</p><div style=\"margin-top:10px;height:15px\"><a href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/\" title=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\"></a></div><p></p>"

There have been a few interesting developments in the C++ and QML/JS editors that I’d like to share with you.</p>\n<p><strong>C++</strong></p>\n<p>We’re currently prototyping what would happen if we replaced our own C++ code model with <a href=\"http://clang.llvm.org/\">clang’s</a>. There’s just a couple of things left that need to be done before we’ll make the experimental branch public. There’ll be more about this in a different post.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://labs.qt.nokia.com/2011/05/26/new-indenter-settings/\">code style settings pages</a> introduced in 2.3 have been overhauled. You can now set up several code style presets and easily switch between them. They can also be exported and imported to share them with your team.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://labs.qt.nokia.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/codestyle1.png\"><img src=\"http://labs.qt.nokia.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/codestyle1.png\" alt=\"Code Style settings page\" title=\"Improved Code Style settings page\" width=\"810\" height=\"536\"></a></p>\n<p>There’s a new feature that helps you keep function declarations and definitions synchronized. Whenever you edit a function signature Creator will check if it can find the matching declaration or definition. If it found it and thinks it can apply your changes there, a little light bulb will appear at the end of the function. Open the list of quick fixes (Alt-Enter) and select ‘Apply changes’ to perform the same changes in the matching code.</p>\n<p>If you’ve tried the <a href=\"http://doc.qt.nokia.com/qtcreator-snapshot/creator-editor-refactoring.%20html#refactoring-c-code\">‘insert definition from declaration’ quick fix</a> before but given up because it didn’t do everything you wanted, try it again! It’s been fixed to put the definition in a more natural spot (after the preceding declaration’s definition instead of at the end of the file) and has also become much smarter about minimizing qualified names (instead of always expanding them fully).</p>\n<p><strong>QML</strong></p>\n<p>There’ve been several improvements that make functionality you know from C++ work in QML. Find Usages now works on QML component names – and globally renaming just about every kind of symbol is now supported as well.</p>\n<p>To aid reading QML and JavaScript code we’ve introduced semantic highlighting to the QML/JS editor. That means code with a special semantic meaning, such as external ids, JS variables, strings with state names and several others can be formatted differently.</p>\n<p>The default color scheme tries to be helpful without being too distracting and doesn’t use different formatting for all of them. You can set it up as you see fit in the editor preferences.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://labs.qt.nokia.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/semantichighlight.png\"><img src=\"http://labs.qt.nokia.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/semantichighlight.png\" alt=\"Semantic highlighting in QML\" title=\"Semantic highlighting in QML\" width=\"654\" height=\"560\"></a><br>\n<a href=\"http://labs.qt.nokia.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/semantichighlightoptions.png\"><img src=\"http://labs.qt.nokia.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/semantichighlightoptions.png\" alt=\"Options for Semantic Highlighting\" title=\"Options for Semantic Highlighting\" width=\"671\" height=\"488\"></a></p>\n<p>We’ve mentioned <a href=\"http://labs.qt.nokia.com/2010/11/30/new-qml-editor-features\">JSlint-style static checks</a> that Creator runs on your source code before. It’s now much easier to run them on the whole project: Clicking Tools-&gt;QmlJS-&gt;Run Checks will scan all projects’ qml and js files and report the results in the QML Analysis filter of the Build Issues tab. There are a couple of new checks as well.</p>\n<p><strong>QML and C++</strong></p>\n<p>When you’re writing a QML module or using QML from a C++ application you’ll often register new types with qmlRegisterType or expose some class instances with setContextProperty. Creator’s C++ code model now scans for these calls and tells the QML one about them. That way, the properties will show up in code completion and the static analyser won’t complain about unknown types.</p>\n<p>However, since it only works when the source code is available, module authors still need to explicitly <a href=\"http://doc.qt.nokia.com/qtcreator-snapshot/creator-qml-modules-with-plugins.html\">generate type information for QML modules with plugins</a> before distributing it.</p>\n<p>For feedback post here, on the Qt Creator <a href=\"http://lists.qt.nokia.com/mailman/listinfo/qt-creator\">mailing list</a> or use the <a href=\"https://bugreports.qt.nokia.com\">bug tracker</a>.</p>"

I have a machine which has several\nnetwork interfaces in different network (it's our monitoring system).  So I\nhave <tt>eth0</tt> with 192.168.1.2 and <tt>eth1</tt> with\n10.0.0.2, and an dns entry pointing from <tt>myname</tt> to\n192.168.1.2.</p>\n\n<p>Problems occur, if hosts in the 10.x.x.x network try to access the hosts.\nAccessing it via it's IP address in that network works, however if they try\nto access him via his other IP address 192.168.1.2 (e.g. because\nthey resolve it via dns), it leads to some problems:</p>\n\n<p>The host send their packet to his IP address (which works), however\nwhen my machine sends the answer, it takes a shortcut, and sends them\ndirectly via <tt>eth1</tt> and with 10.0.0.2 as source IP.  This\nhowever gets filtered by a (stateful) firewall somewhere in between, as\npacket send to 192.168.1.2 are suddenly answered by 10.0.0.2.</p>\n\n<p>So far I found two solutions:  Adjust the DNS to resolve to different IPs\ndepending on the source of the request (ugly) or tell all firewalls to\nalways let packet from my host pass, despite the changes source IP (also\nugly, and probably quite some work).</p>\n\n<p>Is there anything else I can do?  What I would really like, would be a\nway to tell my linux box to always respond with the IP it was talked to,\neven if there would be a shorter way to the origin according to the routing\nrable.  So, if a host 10.0.0.42 contacts my host via the IP 192.168.1.2,\nthe answer packet should come from 192.168.1.2 via <tt>eth0</tt> instead of\ninstead of having a source IP set to 10.0.0.2, it should be send via\n<tt>eth1</tt>.  Is that somehow possible?</p>\n\n<p><b>Update:</b> Wow, that was fast! The ink of my blog is still fresh,\nand I already got the answer!  The solution to my problem is <q>policy\nbased routing</q>.

      "content" : "<p>This article is a quick guide to setting up a Python work environment. It walks you through installing Python with some basic package management tools (distribute, pip, virtualenv), setting up projects, and installing packages.</p>\n\n<h3>Bootstrapping</h3>\n\n<p>First of all we need to have a working Python interpreter. You want to install the latest release of <code>2.7</code> for now (September 2011). Python 3 is gathering momentum but many libraries don’t support it yet.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>In most Linux distributions, and in Mac OS, some Python is already installed. You may, of course, install a different one from scratch. For Mac OS, the <a href=\"http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/\">homebrew</a> version is highly recommended.</p>\n</li>\n\n<li>\n<p>On Windows you install a pre-compiled release from <a href=\"http://python.org/download/\">http://python.org/download/</a>.</p>\n</li>\n\n<li>\n<p>To install from source, you need a C compiler, and a tarball from <a href=\"http://python.org/download/\">http://python.org/download/</a>. The usual <code>./configure; make; make\ninstall</code> should work just fine. Consider installing into a separate folder, e.g. <code>./configure --prefix=/usr/local/Python-2.7</code>, so you can easily remove it at some point in the future.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Now, the typical mistake is to declare victory, and use this Python installation for everything. In time, you want to use various libraries, so you install them on top of Python. Eventually you get a version conflict (some project requires a library which is too new for another project). Fortunately there is a better way: <em>virtualenv</em>.</p>\n\n<p>The command-line examples use <code>$MYPYTHON</code> as placeholder for the Python installation path. This can be <code>/usr</code> for a Linux distribution install, <code>/usr/local</code> for default manual installation, <code>/usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.2</code> for mac Homebrew, or even <code>C:\\Python27</code> on Windows.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re on Linux, and use a Python package from the distribution, it’s a good bet they have virtualenv too. For Debian, Ubuntu and Fedora, the name is <code>python-virtualenv</code>. This may be outdated, so if you experience problems, check the version and consider installing the latest one (see below).</p>\n\n<p>In a fresh Python installation, to get virtualenv, we need to install <em>distribute</em> and <em>pip</em> first. distribute is an older package manager, and pip is newer and more powerful, but it depends on the older one to do heavy lifting. So, download <a href=\"http://python-distribute.org/distribute_setup.py\"><code>distribute_setup.py</code></a>, and, assuming you installed Python in a folder called <code>$MYPYTHON</code>, do the following:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&gt; $MYPYTHON/bin/python distribute_setup.py\n&gt; $MYPYTHON/bin/easy_install pip\n&gt; $MYPYTHON/bin/pip install virtualenv</code></pre>\n\n<p>If everything worked out fine, you should have a script called <code>virtualenv</code> in <code>$MYPYTHON/bin</code>, and you can safely remove <code>distribute_setup.py</code> and <code>distribute-x.y.z.tar.gz</code>.</p>\n\n<p>That’s all you normally install in the global Python folder. Maybe throw in some commonly-used, slow-to-change, takes-a-while-to-compile package like <a href=\"http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/\">PIL</a> or <a href=\"http://www.scipy.org/\">SciPy</a>, or the odd manually-installed kits on Windows, but everything else goes into a virtualenv.</p>\n\n<h3>Virtual insanity</h3>\n\n<p>Say you want to work on <a href=\"https://projects.rosedu.org/projects/wousodjango\">WoUSO</a>, and the documentation tells you that you need to install <a href=\"https://www.djangoproject.com/\">Django</a>. The very first thing you do is create a virtualenv. We’ll use <code>$MYENV</code> as placeholder for the path to a new folder where you want to work:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&gt; $MYPYTHON/bin/virtualenv $MYENV</code></pre>\n\n<p>virtualenv will create the folder, write some files, then run off and get distribute and pip, it should all take a few seconds. When it’s done, you have <code>$MYENV/bin/python</code>, which is a fully functional Python interpreter. Next to it, there is <code>$MYENV/bin/pip</code>, which you can now use to install things:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&gt; $MYENV/bin/pip install Django</code></pre>\n\n<p>This will go to <a href=\"http://pypi.python.org/\">PyPI</a>, look for a package named <code>Django</code>, and install the latest version. The installation happens inside <code>$MYENV</code>, in the <code>lib/python2.7/site-packages</code> subfolder. This Django doesn’t affect the original Python installation or any other virtualenvs you create. Of course, multiple virtualenvs can have different versions of Django.</p>\n\n<h3>Bits and pieces</h3>\n\n<p>Now, if you start happily creating many virtualenvs, installing a lot of packages, you’ll be downloading the same files over and over again. Fortunately, pip can be configured to cache the downloads:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&gt; cat ~/.pip/pip.conf\n[global]\ndownload_cache = ~/.pip/cache</code></pre>\n\n<p>Depending on the setup, sometimes you have to deal with globally-installed packages, for example if you’re using the Python from a Linux distribution. It’s still possible to create a virtualenv that ignores those packages by passing the <code>--no-site-packages</code> option to virtualenv. This simply leaves out the global <code>site-packages</code> folder from Python’s import path.</p>\n\n<p>Some projects include a <code>requirements.txt</code> file in their source tree, which lists dependencies. You install these with <code>pip install -r\nrequirements.txt</code>. Writing your own <code>requirements.txt</code> is easy: each line is a set of arguments for one invocation of pip. Or simply run <code>pip\nfreeze</code>, it generates a list of all the installed packages and their versions.</p>\n\n<p>When you get tired of typing <code>$MYENV/bin/something</code> all the time, you may want to <em>activate</em> the virtualenv. This is a fancy name which simply means that <code>$MYENV/bin</code> is prepended to your current <code>$PATH</code> (and your <code>$PS1</code> is enhanced):</p>\n\n<pre><code>&gt; . $MYENV/bin/activate\n(myenv)&gt; # &quot;python&quot; invokes &quot;$MYENV/bin/python&quot;\n(myenv)&gt; deactivate\n&gt; # back to the original shell environment</code></pre>\n\n<p>If you find yourself working on a package, the kind that has <code>setup.py</code> and installs with pip, you want to install the package in “edit” mode. Check out the source tree, then (assuming you’re in the same folder with <code>setup.py</code>) run <code>pip install -e .</code>. This will install the package in-place. Technically, a link is made in <code>site-packages</code> that extends Python’s import path to find your package, any dependencies in <code>setup.py</code> are installed, and scripts are installed in <code>$MYENV/bin</code>, if the package has any.</p>\n\n<h3>Further reading</h3>\n\n<p>These wonderful tools are available on <a href=\"http://pypi.python.org/\">PyPI</a>, the Python Package Index. Most of them have good documentation that explains more features that did not fit in this article. Also, remember <code>docs.python.org</code> (behold the <a href=\"http://docs.python.org/contents.html\">table of contents</a>), where you can find documentation on the language, a nice tutorial, and excellent documentation for the standard library.</p>"

      "content" : "<p align=\"justify\">The updates keep flowing in from <a title=\"Articles about Facebook on the blog\" href=\"http://exde601e.blogspot.com/search/label/Facebook\" rel=\"tag\">Facebook</a> this month: after introducing <a title=\"Another Facebook overhaul: subscriptions and smart lists\" href=\"http://exde601e.blogspot.com/2011/09/another-facebook-overhaul-subscriptions.html\">subscriptions and smart lists</a>, this week another message popped up after I logged in, announcing further changes to the News Feed. This time the two previous views, ‘Top News’ and ‘Most Recent’ have been merged into a single stream and rebranded as ‘<a title=\"Interesting News, Any Time You Visit\" href=\"http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=10150286921207131\">Top Stories</a>’. Naturally, the updates are all algorithmically selected by Facebook by taking into account the relationship between you and the person and the amount of interaction with the update. The chronological feed is still there, but somewhere down on the page, buried under the things Facebook thinks are more ‘interesting’ to you. Then there is the news ticker, a smaller version of ‘Most recent’ with real-time activity, sticking to the right side of the screen everywhere you go. And to borrow more random stuff from <a title=\"Articles about Google on this blog\" href=\"http://exde601e.blogspot.com/search/label/Google\" rel=\"tag\">Google</a>+, Facebook added two new buttons to the top bar on the right, linking to the profile and the home feed. An odd and useless choice, since the Facebook logo and your picture on the left do exactly the same thing. <a href=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-AKvouTgbcno/Tn4vhxLwh5I/AAAAAAAAHQI/b4dN-XXuAXo/Facebook-Top-Stories.png\"><img style=\"background-image:none;border-right-width:0px;margin:0px auto;padding-left:0px;padding-right:0px;display:block;float:none;border-top-width:0px;border-bottom-width:0px;border-left-width:0px;padding-top:0px\" title=\"Facebook Top Stories\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Facebook Top Stories\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-S-xPMHRz0jc/Tn4vi6bxIGI/AAAAAAAAHQM/7pb94GzGucI/Facebook-Top-Stories_thumb.png\" width=\"640\" height=\"283\"></a></p>  <a name=\"more\"></a>  <p align=\"justify\">While I was mildly positive about the previous round of updates, especially about the smart lists and more fine-grained control, I definitely don’t like this new stream. I simply don’t trust algorithms, either from Facebook or Google or anyone else, choosing what I see and whom I interact with. Sure, you can start tweaking your filters and remove stories, but will that really change anything? I prefer looking at the feed chronologically, but that’s not really an option anymore. The new feed + ticker and combination looks alien, <a title=\"Un-Friendly: The Impersonalization of the Facebook Experience\" href=\"http://www.newsome.org/2011/09/un-friendly-the-impersonalization-of-the-facebook-experience/\">impersonal</a>, and alternating between top and recent stories in the same stream highly confusing. Coupled with subscriptions, this can get very noisy very quickly: I have subscribed to a single user and he already dominates the top stories at certain times during the day; how many smaller updates from friends am I missing during that time? The only solution I found is to use lists more intensively, practically ignoring the main feed and consuming updates only through my custom lists; it looks like they are still served chronologically there, at least for now. I can’t stop thinking, what stops Facebook from inserting adds and other promoted updates in the news feed, like <a title=\"Articles about Twitter on the blog\" href=\"http://exde601e.blogspot.com/search/label/Twitter\" rel=\"tag\">Twitter</a> started doing?</p>   <div style=\"padding-bottom:20px;padding-left:20px;padding-right:20px;background:url() #000000;padding-top:20px\">   <p style=\"padding-bottom:10px;line-height:22px;margin:0px;min-height:48px;padding-left:12px;padding-right:12px;background:#fff;color:#000;font-size:16px!important;padding-top:10px\">The new <a href=\"http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23Facebook\">#Facebook</a> feed is so loud and off-kilter it practically makes me hate my friends for posting stuff.

It looks to me like Facebook tries to be everything to all people, but has started to loose sight of their original <a title=\"The Evolution of Facebook’s Mission Statement\" href=\"http://www.observer.com/2009/media/evolution-facebooks-mission-statement\">mission</a>: we’re far removed from <em><q>a social utility that connects you with the people around you</q></em>. Personally I don’t want a news site or a place to share stuff, there are many other better solutions out there. <img style=\"background-image:none;border-right-width:0px;margin:0px auto;padding-left:0px;padding-right:0px;display:block;float:none;border-top-width:0px;border-bottom-width:0px;border-left-width:0px;padding-top:0px\" title=\"Facebook Top stories options\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Facebook Top stories options\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-f_uEp3mRLns/Tn4vji2arUI/AAAAAAAAHQQ/5fyfWuJ2yeQ/Facebook-Top-stories-options.png\" width=\"519\" height=\"330\"></p>  <p align=\"justify\">On top of that, Facebook has also changed the notification system, reducing the number of emails users receive. This can prove a double-edged sword for the network: people who regularly visit will still come to the site regardless of the notifications they receive per email, but casual users will probably just assume nothing new has happened and log in less and less to Facebook. You can still return to the usual frequency from ‘Account Settings’ by unchecking ‘<em>Send me important updates and summary emails instead of individual notification emails</em>’ under ‘Notifications’. I personally have switched to following notifications through RSS in <a title=\"Articles about Google Reader on the blog\" href=\"http://exde601e.blogspot.com/search/label/Reader\" rel=\"tag\">Google Reader</a>, but how many of the 700+ Million users have heard of that?<img style=\"background-image:none;border-right-width:0px;margin:0px auto;padding-left:0px;padding-right:0px;display:block;float:none;border-top-width:0px;border-bottom-width:0px;border-left-width:0px;padding-top:0px\" title=\"Facebook Recent Stories in the new News Feed\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Facebook Recent Stories in the new News Feed\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-QOX9-hA6a_s/Tn4vkOucgpI/AAAAAAAAHQU/EwG3hZdjyJQ/Facebook-Recent-Stories.png\" width=\"530\" height=\"105\"></p>  <p align=\"justify\">But bigger changes still are on their way, as <a title=\"Facebook Announces Major Changes at F8: Here Are All the Announcements\" href=\"http://siliconfilter.com/facebook-f8-here-are-all-the-announcements/\">announced at the latest f8 developer conference</a>, some of them more concerning than others. It all revolves round the new ticker and the Open Graph, which will allow more <a title=\"&quot;Read&quot; in Facebook - It&#39;s Not a Button, So Be Careful What You Click!\" href=\"http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/read_in_facebook_social_news_apps.php\">actions</a> beside the already ubiquitous ‘Like’ and a kind of <em><q>frictionless</q></em> sharing never seen before. I have yet to see this in actions, as it still needs to be included into apps and approved by the users to take off, but some reactions have already crystalized: from the <a title=\"Facebook&#39;s Open Graph On Steroids: What Happens to Privacy?\" href=\"http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/facebooks_open_graph_on_steroids_what_happens_to_p.php\">privacy problems</a> to <a title=\"Not Sharing Is Caring\" href=\"http://www.slate.com/?id=2304425&amp;pagenum=all\">noise</a> and reduced relevance to down-right <a title=\"Facebook is scaring me\" href=\"http://scripting.com/stories/2011/09/24/facebookIsScaringMe.html\">fear</a>. I for one think that this kind of automatic sharing will actually devalue the sharing experience instead of making it more streamlined, because it takes away the personal, the social element; you can’t know if the people have shared content with intent or the app did it for them. It also completely kills curation on Facebook, which contradicts the whole ‘Subscription’ concept. <img style=\"background-image:none;border-right-width:0px;margin:0px auto;padding-left:0px;padding-right:0px;display:block;float:none;border-top-width:0px;border-bottom-width:0px;border-left-width:0px;padding-top:0px\" title=\"Facebook Ticker\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Facebook Ticker\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-Wo7gQUivzaY/Tn4vkrbQxOI/AAAAAAAAHQY/HL2AsT8BcJY/Facebook-Ticker.png\" width=\"580\" height=\"165\"></p>  <p align=\"justify\">As for <a title=\"Introducing Timeline\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/about/timeline\">Timeline</a>, the new Facebook profile that will showcase your entire ‘life’ as recorded in the interactions and updates on the social network, I am not even remotely impressed. The concept is nice, but there are problems with the implementation, making the idea less useful: I <a title=\"Facebook Memories gets the wrong date\" href=\"http://exde601e.blogspot.com/2011/03/facebook-memories-gets-wrong-date.html\">noticed some time ago</a> that Facebook records photos by the date you upload them and discards any metadata in the file, resulting in photo albums being horribly misplaced in the story of your life. Even 6 months on, the problem persists, as noted in this update by Jesse Stay, asking how to correct the date of photos. In the end, do you want to spend time fixing photo dates that Facebook deleted in the first place just to have an accurate profile? Who does that benefit more, the user or the network?<img style=\"background-image:none;border-right-width:0px;margin:0px auto;padding-left:0px;padding-right:0px;display:block;float:none;border-top-width:0px;border-bottom-width:0px;border-left-width:0px;padding-top:0px\" title=\"Facebook broken photo date in Timeline\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Facebook broken photo date in Timeline\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-brBmLtUrSbA/Tn4vlTc9kBI/AAAAAAAAHQc/cCaUBdY9Hq8/Facebook-broken-photo-date-Timeline.png\" width=\"580\" height=\"250\"></p><div><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2788216437526312119-8202538250779308539?l=exde601e.blogspot.com\" alt=\"\"></div><div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/fors-by-exde601e?a=8PQLFPwwpgw:UI__0gVsSCw:4cEx4HpKnUU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/fors-by-exde601e?i=8PQLFPwwpgw:UI__0gVsSCw:4cEx4HpKnUU\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/fors-by-exde601e?a=8PQLFPwwpgw:UI__0gVsSCw:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/fors-by-exde601e?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/fors-by-exde601e?a=8PQLFPwwpgw:UI__0gVsSCw:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/fors-by-exde601e?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/fors-by-exde601e?a=8PQLFPwwpgw:UI__0gVsSCw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/fors-by-exde601e?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/fors-by-exde601e/~4/8PQLFPwwpgw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

Look at the article for\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security\"><abbr title=\"Transport Layer Security\"><abbr title=\"Transport Layer Security\"><span>TLS</span></abbr></abbr> on Wikipedia</a> for some background on this.</p>\n<h1>Theory of operation</h1>\n<p>To establish a <abbr title=\"Secure Sockets Layer\"><span>SSL</span></abbr> connection, four messages need to be exchanged\nbetween client and server. With a latency of 50 ms, we have a 200 ms\noverhead to establish the connection (plus <span>TCP</span> handshake). Moreover,\nto share a common secret, both the client and the server needs to\nachieve some public-key cryptographic operations which are costly, computation-wise.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://d1g3mdmxf8zbo9.cloudfront.net/images/benchs-ssl/ssl-handshake.png\" alt=\"SSL full handshake\"></p>\n<p>To avoid a full <abbr title=\"Secure Sockets Layer\"><span>SSL</span></abbr> handshake each time a client request a resource,\nit is possible for the client to request an abbreviated handshake,\nsaving a complete round-trip (100 ms) and avoiding the costliest part\nof the full <abbr title=\"Secure Sockets Layer\"><span>SSL</span></abbr> handshake.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://d1g3mdmxf8zbo9.cloudfront.net/images/benchs-ssl/ssl-handshake-with-resume.png\" alt=\"SSL abbreviated handshake\"></p>\n<p>Two mechanisms can be used to accomplish an abbreviated handshake:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>When the server sends the “Server Hello” message, it can include a\n   <strong>session identifier</strong>. The client should store it and present it\n   in the “Client Hello” message of the next session. If the server\n   finds the corresponding session in its cache and accepts to resume\n   the session, it will send back the same session identifier and will\n   continue with the abbreviated <abbr title=\"Secure Sockets Layer\"><span>SSL</span></abbr> handshake. Otherwise, it will\n   issue a new session identifier and switch to a full handshake. This\n   mechanism is detailed in <a href=\"http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246\"><span>RFC</span> 5246</a>. It is the most common\n   mechanism because it exists since earlier versions of <abbr title=\"Secure Sockets Layer\"><span>SSL</span></abbr>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In the last exchange of a full <abbr title=\"Secure Sockets Layer\"><span>SSL</span></abbr> handshake, the server can\n   include a “New Session Ticket” message (not represented in the\n   handshake described in the picture) which will contain the complete\n   session state (including the master secret negotiated between the\n   client and the server and the cipher suite used). Therefore, this\n   state is encrypted and integrity-protected by a key known only by\n   the server. This opaque datum is known as a <strong>session ticket</strong>. The\n   details lie in <a href=\"http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5077\"><span>RFC</span> 5077</a> which supersedes\n   <a href=\"http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4507\"><span>RFC</span> 4507</a>.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The ticket mechanism is a <abbr title=\"Transport Layer Security\"><span>TLS</span></abbr> extension. The client can advertise its\nsupport by sending an empty “Session Ticket” extension in the “Client\nHello” message. The server will answer with an empty “Session Ticket”\nextension in its “Server Hello” message if it supports it. If one of\nthem does not support this extension, they can fallback to the session\nidentifier mechanism built into <abbr title=\"Secure Sockets Layer\"><span>SSL</span></abbr>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5077\"><span>RFC</span> 5077</a> identifies situations where tickets are desirable\nover session identifiers. The main improvement is to avoid to maintain\na server-side session cache since the whole session state is\nremembered by the client, not the server. A session cache can be\ncostly in term of memory and difficult to share between multiple hosts\nwhen requests are load-balanced across servers.</p>\n<h1>Browser support</h1>\n<p>Session identifiers are part of <abbr title=\"Secure Sockets Layer\"><span>SSL</span></abbr> and are therefore supported since\na long time by clients and servers. However, session tickets are an\noptional <abbr title=\"Transport Layer Security\"><span>TLS</span></abbr> extension and therefore, the support is not as widespread\nas for session identifiers. Support for tickets was added in\n<a href=\"http://www.openssl.org\">OpenSSL</a> 0.9.8f (October 2007). In <a href=\"http://www.gnu.org/s/gnutls/\">GnuTLS</a>, this is\nversion 2.9.3 (August 2009). For <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/pki/nss/\"><span>NSS</span></a>, the set of libraries\nbehind most browsers, support of <span>RFC</span> 5077 is in version 3.12 (June\n2008). <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa380123(v=VS.85).aspx\">Schannel</a>, Microsoft implementation of <abbr title=\"Transport Layer Security\"><span>TLS</span></abbr>, does not\ncurrently supports tickets.</p>\n<p>To check if a browser supports session resume without and with\ntickets, I have written a <a href=\"https://github.com/vincentbernat/rfc5077/blob/master/rfc5077-server.c\">web server</a> listening to\nseveral ports with different configurations (session cache disabled or\nenabled, ticket support disabled or enabled). With the help of some\nJavascript, it is possible to interact with this server to determine\nwhat kind of session resume a browser support.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://d1g3mdmxf8zbo9.cloudfront.net/images/benchs-ssl/rfc5077-screenshot.png\" alt=\"Checking for browser support for session resume\"></p>\n<p>It is difficult to get extensive results this way since you need to\ninstall a lot of browsers to get something valuable. Surprisingly,\nAndroid 2.3.4 browser (as shipped by Cyanogen Mod) does not support\nany session resume.</p>\n<p>Another way to check if a browser supports session resume is to use a\nsniffer and to spot “Client Hello” messages. If a client tries to\nresume a session, it will use an appropriate session identifier or\nsend a ticket. A simple <a href=\"https://github.com/vincentbernat/rfc5077/blob/master/rfc5077-pcap.c\">program parsing <span>PCAP</span> files</a>\nallows to automate this task and get some interesting statistics. Here\nare random facts from more than 300 000 requests (38 000 clients) to\na customer care service of an important French telco:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>35% of requests exhibit support of tickets;</li>\n<li>53.3% of requests ask to resume without tickets; 25.6% with tickets;</li>\n<li>67.2% of requests exhibit support of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication\"><span>SNI</span></a>;</li>\n<li>86.7% of requests use <abbr title=\"Transport Layer Security\"><span>TLS</span></abbr> 1.0; the remaining uses <abbr title=\"Secure Sockets Layer\"><span>SSL</span></abbr> 3.0; almost no <abbr title=\"Transport Layer Security\"><span>TLS</span></abbr> 1.1/1.2;</li>\n<li>in average, a client execute 8 <abbr title=\"Secure Sockets Layer\"><span>SSL</span></abbr> handshakes;</li>\n<li>ciphers supported by all clients are <span>3DES</span>-<span>SHA</span>, <span>RC4</span>-<span>MD5</span> and <span>RC4</span>-<span>SHA</span>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With some log analysis to match each requests with the appropriate\nuser agent, we can split the world in two parts: browsers supporting\n<span>RFC</span> 5077 (Chrome and Firefox) and browsers not supporting <span>RFC</span> 5077\n(Internet Explorer, Opera 9.80, Safari for MacOS and iOS and Android browser).</p>\n<h1>Web server support</h1>\n<p>There is no unique recipe to configure a web server to handle\nappropriately and efficiently session resume. Here are some generic\ndirections :</p>\n<ul>\n<li>if the web server uses multiple processes, you need to configure a\n  shared memory session cache; usually, tickets will work just fine in\n  this setup;</li>\n<li>if you use local load-balancing, one easy way to avoid any problem\n  is to use ensure that one <span>IP</span> is mapped to one server (either\n  statically with hashing or dynamically with a stick table); if your\n  load-balancer understands <abbr title=\"Secure Sockets Layer\"><span>SSL</span></abbr>, you can also use session identifier\n  (and disable tickets<sup><a href=\"http://vincent.bernat.im/en/blog/atom.xml#fn:1\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup>) to build a stick table;</li>\n<li>if you don’t want to apply the previous advice, you need to share\n  the session cache between the servers with something like\n  <a href=\"http://memcached.org/\">memcached</a> and disable tickets;</li>\n<li>if you use global load-balancing (<span>DNS</span> based), there\n  is no need to ensure that session resumption works across geographic\n  pools since a user will usually stick to one pool.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Remember that only one client out of three supports <abbr title=\"Transport Layer Security\"><span>TLS</span></abbr>\ntickets. Therefore, you cannot rely on them to ensure proper session\nresume. You need a session cache.</p>\n<h2>Setting a session cache with Apache <span>&amp;</span> nginx</h2>\n<p><strong>Apache</strong> features two different <abbr title=\"Secure Sockets Layer\"><span>SSL</span></abbr> engines. The first one is\n<a href=\"http://www.modssl.org/\">mod_ssl</a> and uses OpenSSL as backend. It is possible to setup\na shared session cache with <code>SSLSessionCache</code> but the\nmemcached-enabled session cache is\n<a href=\"http://journal.paul.querna.org/articles/2010/07/10/overclocking-mod_ssl/\">available only in the development branch</a>. You can\nalso get one by switching to <a href=\"http://www.outoforder.cc/projects/apache/mod_gnutls/\">mod_gnutls</a> backend. The\ncache is enabled with <code>GnuTLSCache</code>. In this case, do not enable\ntickets because they cannot be shared.</p>\n<p>With <strong>nginx</strong>, you need to enable the shared session cache with\n<code>ssl_session_cache</code>. Currently, it lacks a memcached-enabled session\ncache but <a href=\"http://hezmatt.org/~mpalmer/blog/2011/06/28/ssl-session-caching-in-nginx.html\">Matt Palmer has some patches to add it</a> to\nthe 0.8 branch. However, those patches can have a serious impact on\nnginx performance since retrieving a session from memcached is done\nsynchronously (mostly because a limitation in OpenSSL design who does\nnot allow to register asynchronous callbacks with\n<code>SSL_CTX_sess_set_get_cb()</code>).</p>\n<p>As a proof of concept, I have also added a similar feature to\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bumptech/stud\"><strong>stud</strong></a>, the scalable <abbr title=\"Transport Layer Security\"><span>TLS</span></abbr> unwrapping daemon, a very efficient\nnetwork proxy terminating <abbr title=\"Secure Sockets Layer\"><span>SSL</span></abbr> connections. The same limitation as for\n<em>nginx</em> applies: performances will suffer. Look at the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bumptech/stud/pull/29\">pull request</a> for more details.</p>\n<h2>Sharing tickets</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5077\"><span>RFC</span> 5077</a> tells tickets allow to load-balance requests\nacross servers. However, to the best of my knowledge, there is\ncurrently no web server able to share tickets across a pool. Actually,\nwhen a server initializes its <abbr title=\"Secure Sockets Layer\"><span>SSL</span></abbr> stack, it will randomly generate\nsome keys that will be used to protect and encrypt tickets. In\nOpenSSL, from <code>ssl/ssl_lib.c</code>:</p>\n<div><pre>    <span>/* Setup <span>RFC4507</span> ticket keys */</span>\n    <span>if</span> <span>((</span><span>RAND_pseudo_bytes</span><span>(</span><span>ret</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>tlsext_tick_key_name</span><span>,</span> <span>16</span><span>)</span> <span>&lt;=</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span>\n            <span>||</span> <span>(</span><span>RAND_bytes</span><span>(</span><span>ret</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>tlsext_tick_hmac_key</span><span>,</span> <span>16</span><span>)</span> <span>&lt;=</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span>\n            <span>||</span> <span>(</span><span>RAND_bytes</span><span>(</span><span>ret</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>tlsext_tick_aes_key</span><span>,</span> <span>16</span><span>)</span> <span>&lt;=</span> <span>0</span><span>))</span>\n            <span>ret</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>options</span> <span>|=</span> <span>SSL_OP_NO_TICKET</span><span>;</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>Therefore, with a round-robin load-balanced pool of servers, tickets\nhave to be disabled because servers would not accept tickets from\nneighbors. One way to solve this is to generate keys deterministically\nby hashing some common secret with the private key. I have implemented\nthis approach for <em>stud</em>. Here is a simplified version (no error\nhandling, no allocation) of the <a href=\"https://github.com/bumptech/stud/pull/30\">pull request for this feature</a>:</p>\n<div><pre>    <span>unsigned</span> <span>char</span> <span>keys</span><span>[</span><span>48</span><span>];</span>\n    <span>EVP_PKEY</span> <span>*</span><span>pkey</span> <span>=</span> <span>grab_private_key</span><span>();</span>\n\n    <span>/* To get our key, we sign the seed with the private key */</span>\n    <span>unsigned</span> <span>int</span> <span>siglen</span><span>;</span>\n    <span>unsigned</span> <span>char</span> <span>sign</span><span>[</span><span>LARGE_ENOUGH</span><span>];</span>\n    <span>EVP_MD_CTX</span> <span>mdctx</span><span>;</span>\n    <span>EVP_MD_CTX_init</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mdctx</span><span>);</span>\n    <span>EVP_SignInit</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mdctx</span><span>,</span> <span>EVP_sha256</span><span>());</span>\n    <span>EVP_SignUpdate</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mdctx</span><span>,</span> <span>some_secret</span><span>,</span> <span>strlen</span><span>(</span><span>some_secret</span><span>));</span>\n    <span>EVP_SignFinal</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mdctx</span><span>,</span> <span>sign</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>siglen</span><span>,</span> <span>pkey</span><span>);</span>\n\n    <span>/* And we keep only the first bytes. */</span>\n    <span>memcpy</span><span>(</span><span>keys</span><span>,</span> <span>sign</span><span>,</span> <span>sizeof</span><span>(</span><span>keys</span><span>));</span>\n\n    <span>/* Tell OpenSSL to use those keys */</span>\n    <span>SSL_CTX_set_tlsext_ticket_keys</span><span>(</span><span>ctx</span><span>,</span> <span>keys</span><span>,</span> <span>sizeof</span><span>(</span><span>keys</span><span>));</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<h2>Testing</h2>\n<p>While tests can be done with just <code>openssl s_client</code> and <code>openssl\nsess_id</code>, testing all aspects can take a lot of time. For this\npurpose, I have written a\n<a href=\"https://github.com/vincentbernat/rfc5077/blob/master/rfc5077-client.c\">client testing session resume with and without tickets</a>. Here\nis a typical result:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://d1g3mdmxf8zbo9.cloudfront.net/images/benchs-ssl/rfc5077-twitter.png\" alt=\"twitter.com RFC session resume\"></p>\n<p>The program will try to establish five consecutive <abbr title=\"Secure Sockets Layer\"><span>SSL</span></abbr> connections for\neach <span>IP</span> without and with tickets. For each <span>IP</span>, the last four <abbr title=\"Secure Sockets Layer\"><span>SSL</span></abbr>\nconnections should always reuse the first <abbr title=\"Secure Sockets Layer\"><span>SSL</span></abbr> session. Here, Twitter\nweb servers seem properly configured: for each <span>IP</span>, session resume is\nsuccessful. Their web servers do not support tickets or they may have\ndisabled it because they share the session cache between servers\ninside the same pool.</p>\n<div>\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5077\"><span>RFC</span> 5077</a> describes interactions between session\n  identifiers and session tickets. When using tickets, the server\n  <em>should</em> send back an empty session identifier. The client <em>may</em>\n  present an empty session identifier or generate one. However,\n  for all practical purposes, it seems that servers send back a\n  non-empty session identifier and clients just stick to this\n  identifier. Please, investigate if you want to use <abbr title=\"Secure Sockets Layer\"><abbr title=\"Secure Sockets Layer\"><abbr title=\"Secure Sockets Layer\"><span>SSL</span></abbr></abbr></abbr> session\n  identifiers for load-balancing while keeping tickets enabled. <a href=\"http://vincent.bernat.im/en/blog/atom.xml#fnref:1\" title=\"Jump back to footnote 1 in the text\">↩</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>"

      "content" : "In general QPixmap is the class I dislike the most in the Qt graphics stack. It is not because it did anything wrong, or has annoying bugs. It is merely that painting on a QPixmap can produce a huge slowdown. Maybe it is even the immediate painting model I dislike so much.<br><br>In theory the QPixmap should represent the graphics memory and in theory painting this to another piece of graphics memory should be very fast. But reality is different, e.g. with directFB/X it is possible that your graphics memory resides in the host memory because you have allocated too much. X (EXA, UXA...) has migration strategies, directFB will just allocate it in system memory and it will stay there. So your graphics memory class might not be always allocated in graphics memory.<br><br>The athur painting capabilities of Qt4 were very nice but Hardware/X/directFB might not be capable of handling all the advanced concepts (perspective transformation, drawing other pixmaps scaled) and the paintengines then need to fallback into the raster path, but the raster path needs to work on a QImage and this is where stuff get terrible. There will be a download of the memory (slow), there might be a change in color (ARGB -&gt; pre multiplied ARGB?), then the fallback, and then uploading of the memory again. So even classes like QGraphicsBlurEffect go through QPixmap -&gt; QImage -&gt; QPixmap (or at least used to).<br><br>So the basic problem with QPixmap and the immediate painting model is, only once you are done with painting everything, you know if starting with a QPixmap would have made sense. If Qt5 wouldn't be all about OpenGL, I would have lobbied hard to make QPixmap an internal class and use it to 'cache' QImage that have peen painted a lot.<br><br>After all this love/hate with QPixmap there were still things I didn't know. For Qt5 I am working on the directFB lighthouse plugin and started to work on make more tests pass. The thing I did not know was that by default the QPixmap has no alpha channel, only if either a mask is set or the pixmap is filled with a color that has an alpha channel the QPixmap will end up having an alpha channel and be ARGB. This means that a lighouse plugin providing a QPlatformPixmap implementation needs to be able to provide an ARGB and a RGB based pixmap and switch between them.<div><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/13875843-4869877740493285023?l=zecke.blogspot.com\" alt=\"\"></div>"

The file must contain the following lines:<br><br><span style=\"font-family:courier new\">export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./firebird<br></span><span style=\"font-family:courier new\">export FIREBIRD=.<br></span><span style=\"font-family:courier new\">./vvv</span><br><br>where the last line contains the name if the program to run, in this case <span style=\"font-family:courier new\">vvv</span>.<br><br>Now you should be able to start your program executing the script. You cannot directly execute the program because it needs the environment variables set by the script.<div><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7098835175438692935-5410631847337260216?l=accountingplusplus.blogspot.com\" alt=\"\"></div>"

      "content" : "<img src=\"http://planet.debian.org/heads/mjg59.png\" width=\"69\" height=\"85\" alt=\"\" align=\"right\" style=\"float:right\">  An obvious question is why Linux doesn't support UEFI secure booting. Let's ignore the issues of key distribution and the GPL and all of those things, and instead just focus on what would be required. There's two components - the signed binary and the authenticated variables.<br><br>The UEFI 2.3.1 spec describes the modification to the binary format required to produce a signed binary. It's not especially difficult - you add an extra entry to the image directory, generate a hash of the entire binary other than the checksum, the certificate directory entry and the signatures themselves, encrypt that hash with your key and embed the encrypted hash in the binary. The problem has been that there was a disagreement between Microsoft and Intel over whether this signature was supposed to include the PKCS header or not, and until earlier this week the only widely available developer firmware (Intel's) was incompatible with the only widely available signed OS (Microsoft's). There's further hilarity in that the specification lists six supported hash algorithms, but the implementations will only accept two. So pretty normal, really. Developing towards a poorly defined target is a pain. Now that there's more clarity we'll probably have a signing tool before too long.<br><br>Authenticated variables are the other part of the puzzle. If a variable requires authentication, the operating system's attempt to write it will fail unless the new data is appropriately signed. The key databases (white and blacklists) are examples of authenticated variables. The signing actually takes place in userspace, and the handoff between the kernel and firmware is identical for both this case and the unauthenticated case. The only problem in Linux's support here is that our EFI variable support was written to a pre-1.0 version of the EFI specification which stated that variables had a maximum size of 1024 bytes, and this limitation ended up exposed to userspace. So all we really need to do there is add a new interface to let arbitrary sized variables be written.<br><br>Summary: We don't really support secure boot right now, but that's ok because you can't buy any hardware that supports it yet. Adding support is probably about a week's worth of effort at most.<br><br><img src=\"http://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=mjg59&amp;ditemid=6054\" alt=\"comment count unavailable\" height=\"12\" style=\"vertical-align:middle\" width=\"30\"> comments"

      "content" : "<img src=\"http://planet.debian.org/heads/mjg59.png\" width=\"69\" height=\"85\" alt=\"\" align=\"right\" style=\"float:right\">  Microsoft have <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/b8/archive/2011/09/22/protecting-the-pre-os-environment-with-uefi.aspx\">responded</a> to suggestions that Windows 8 may make it difficult to boot alternative operating systems. What's interesting is that at no point do they contradict anything I've said. As things stand, Windows 8 certified systems will make it either more difficult or impossible to install alternative operating systems. But let's have some more background.<br><br>We became aware of this issue in early August. Since then, we at Red Hat have been discussing the problem with other Linux vendors, hardware vendors and BIOS vendors. We've been making sure that we understood the ramifications of the policy in order to avoid saying anything that wasn't backed up by facts. These are the facts:<ul><br><li>Windows 8 certification requires that hardware ship with UEFI secure boot enabled.<br></li><li>Windows 8 certification does not require that the user be able to disable UEFI secure boot, and we've already been informed by hardware vendors that some hardware will not have this option.<br></li><li>Windows 8 certification does not require that the system ship with any keys other than Microsoft's.<br></li><li>A system that ships with UEFI secure boot enabled and only includes Microsoft's signing keys will only securely boot Microsoft operating systems.</li></ul><br>Microsoft have a dominant position in the desktop operating system market. Despite Apple's huge comeback over the past decade, their worldwide share of the desktop market is <a href=\"http://www.gartner.com/it/page.jsp?id=1744216\">below 5%</a>. Linux is far below that. Microsoft own well over 90% of the market. Competition in that market is tough, and vendors will take every break they can get. That includes the Windows logo program, in which Microsoft give incentives to vendors to sell hardware that meets their certification requirements. Vendors who choose not to follow the certification requirements will be at a disadvantage in the marketplace. So while it's up to vendors to choose whether or not to follow the certification requirements, Microsoft's dominant position means that they'd be losing sales by doing so.<br><br>Why is this a problem? Because there's no central certification authority for UEFI signing keys. Microsoft can require that hardware vendors include their keys. Their competition can't. A system that ships with Microsoft's signing keys and no others will be unable to perform secure boot of any operating system other than Microsoft's. No other vendor has the same position of power over the hardware vendors. Red Hat is unable to ensure that every OEM carries their signing key. Nor is Canonical. Nor is Nvidia, or AMD or any other PC component manufacturer. Microsoft's influence here is greater than even Intel's. <br><br>What does this mean for the end user? Microsoft claim that the customer is in control of their PC. That's true, if by \"customer\" they mean \"hardware manufacturer\". The end user is not guaranteed the ability to install extra signing keys in order to securely boot the operating system of their choice. The end user is not guaranteed the ability to disable this functionality. The end user is not guaranteed that their system will include the signing keys that would be required for them to swap their graphics card for one from another vendor, or replace their network card and still be able to netboot, or install a newer SATA controller and have it recognise their hard drive in the firmware. The end user is no longer in control of their PC.<br><br>If Microsoft were serious about giving the end user control, they'd be mandating that systems ship without any keys installed. The user would then have the ability to make an informed and conscious decision to limit the flexibility of their system and install the keys. The user would be told what they'd be gaining and what they'd be giving up.<br><br>The final irony? If the user has no control over the installed keys, the user has no way to indicate that they don't trust Microsoft products. They can prevent their system booting malware. They can prevent their system booting Red Hat, Ubuntu, FreeBSD, OS X or any other operating system. But they can't prevent their system from running Windows 8.<br><br>Microsoft's rebuttal is entirely factually accurate. But it's also misleading. The truth is that Microsoft's move removes control from the end user and places it in the hands of Microsoft and the hardware vendors. The truth is that it makes it more difficult to run anything other than Windows. The truth is that UEFI secure boot is a valuable and worthwhile feature that Microsoft are misusing to gain tighter control over the market. And the truth is that Microsoft haven't even attempted to argue otherwise.<br><br><img src=\"http://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=mjg59&amp;ditemid=5850\" alt=\"comment count unavailable\" height=\"12\" style=\"vertical-align:middle\" width=\"30\"> comments"

The entire code is available in the usual <a href=\"http://github.com/ariya/X2\">X2 git repo</a> (or <a href=\"http://gitorious.org/ofi-labs/x2\">the alternative repo</a>), look under <code>webkit/foldervis</code> (you <a href=\"http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/\">need</a> Qt 4.6 or later versions). Keep in mind that the visualization is interactive. When you click on a certain block, it will expand (with some nice animation) and show what is underneath that block.</p>\n<p>For the interface, we use the excellent <a href=\"http://martine.github.com/webtreemap/demo/demo.html\">webtreemap</a> component from <a href=\"http://neugierig.org\">Evan Martin</a> (try the <a href=\"http://neugierig.org/software/chromium/bloat/\">live demo</a>). It’s a treemap implementation using DOM, CSS, and JavaScript. Other treemap implementations exist, check for example Nicolas’ Canvas-based <a href=\"http://blog.thejit.org/assets/bloat/\">treemap demo</a> based on his <a href=\"http://thejit.org/\">InfoVis toolkit</a>.</p>\n<p>The crawling process itself is carried out in a simple Qt-based class. Let’s have a look at this native world. First of all, we need a simple structure to hold the crawling result:</p>\n\n<div><div><pre><span>struct</span> Entry <span>{</span>\n    <span>QString</span> name<span>;</span>\n    <span>int</span> size<span>;</span>\n    <span>QList</span><span>&lt;</span>Entry<span>&gt;</span> children<span>;</span>\n<span>}</span><span>;</span></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>And then let’s declare a class of the crawler implementation, conveniently called <code>Crawler</code>. The reason why it is a QObject (with some signals and slots) will be obvious soon:</p>\n\n<div><div><pre><span>class</span> Crawler<span>:</span> <span>public</span> <span>QObject</span>\n<span>{</span>\n    <span>Q_OBJECT</span>\n    Q_PROPERTY<span>(</span><span>QString</span> tree READ tree<span>)</span>\n \n<span>public</span><span>:</span>\n    Crawler<span>(</span><span>QObject</span> <span>*</span>parent<span>)</span><span>;</span>\n    <span>QString</span> tree<span>(</span><span>)</span> const<span>;</span>\n \n<span>public</span> <span>slots</span><span>:</span>\n    <span>void</span> start<span>(</span><span>const</span> <span>QString</span> <span>&amp;</span>dir<span>)</span><span>;</span>\n \n<span>signals</span><span>:</span>\n    <span>void</span> progress<span>(</span><span>int</span> count<span>)</span><span>;</span>\n    <span>void</span> finished<span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>\n \n<span>private</span><span>:</span>\n    <span>QString</span> m_dir<span>;</span>\n    <span>int</span> m_count<span>;</span>\n    Entry m_rootEntry<span>;</span>\n \n<span>protected</span><span>:</span>\n    Entry search<span>(</span><span>const</span> <span>QString</span> <span>&amp;</span>dir<span>)</span><span>;</span>\n<span>}</span><span>;</span></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Crawling is triggered by calling its <code>start()</code> function, passing the name of the directory to be crawled. Surprisingly, the implementation of this function is really simple since it passes the flow to the <code>search()</code> function which does the actual heavy-duty crawling.</p>\n\n<div><div><pre><span>void</span> Crawler<span>::</span><span>start</span><span>(</span><span>const</span> <span>QString</span> <span>&amp;</span>dir<span>)</span>\n<span>{</span>\n    m_dir <span>=</span> dir<span>;</span>\n    m_count <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>\n    m_rootEntry <span>=</span> search<span>(</span>m_dir<span>)</span><span>;</span>\n    emit finished<span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>\n<span>}</span></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Since we want to traverse to all the subdirectories, this is a recursive process:</p>\n\n<div><div><pre>Entry Crawler<span>::</span><span>search</span><span>(</span><span>const</span> <span>QString</span> <span>&amp;</span>path<span>)</span>\n<span>{</span>\n    <span>QList</span><span>&lt;</span>Entry<span>&gt;</span> children<span>;</span>\n \n    <span>int</span> total <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>\n \n    m_count<span>++;</span>\n    emit progress<span>(</span>m_count<span>)</span><span>;</span>\n    <span>QApplication</span><span>::</span><span>processEvents</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>\n \n    <span>QFileInfoList</span> list <span>=</span> <span>QDir</span><span>(</span>path<span>)</span>.<span>entryInfoList</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>\n    <span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>int</span> i <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> i <span>&lt;</span> list.<span>count</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>++</span>i<span>)</span> <span>{</span>\n        Entry entry<span>;</span>\n        <span>QFileInfo</span> fi <span>=</span> list.<span>at</span><span>(</span>i<span>)</span><span>;</span>\n        <span>if</span> <span>(</span>fi.<span>fileName</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>&quot;.&quot;</span> <span>||</span> fi.<span>fileName</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>&quot;..&quot;</span><span>)</span>\n            continue<span>;</span>\n        <span>if</span> <span>(</span>fi.<span>isDir</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> fi.<span>baseName</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>!=</span> <span>&quot;.&quot;</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>\n            entry <span>=</span> search<span>(</span>fi.<span>absoluteFilePath</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>\n        <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>\n            entry.<span>name</span> <span>=</span> fi.<span>fileName</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>\n            entry.<span>size</span> <span>=</span> fi.<span>size</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>\n        <span>}</span>\n        total <span>+=</span> entry.<span>size</span><span>;</span>\n        children.<span>append</span><span>(</span>entry<span>)</span><span>;</span>\n    <span>}</span>\n \n    Entry entry<span>;</span>\n    entry.<span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>QFileInfo</span><span>(</span>path<span>)</span>.<span>fileName</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>\n    entry.<span>children</span> <span>=</span> children<span>;</span>\n    entry.<span>size</span> <span>=</span> total<span>;</span>\n \n    <span>return</span> entry<span>;</span>\n<span>}</span></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>If you are familiar with Qt, nothing is mysterious about the above implementation. Note also that before processing every directory, we trigger the <code>progress</code> signal. We will find out soon how we can use that.</p>\n<p>An important point I would like to make is the use of <code>processEvents()</code>. Since this is supposed to be an example, we keep the code as simple as possible, without the use of thread and synchronization and other similar magic. Thus, the call to <code>processEvents</code> is necessary to allow Qt main event loop to process all the events, including firing signals and invoking the corresponding slots.</p>\n<p>So up till now, we are basically in the <strong>native side</strong> of the application. The <strong>web side</strong> is about the webtreemap component. We run this conveniently inside our own subclass of QWebView:</p>\n\n<div><div><pre><span>class</span> Visualizer<span>:</span> <span>public</span> <span>QWebView</span>\n<span>{</span>\n    <span>Q_OBJECT</span>\n \n<span>public</span><span>:</span>\n    Visualizer<span>(</span><span>const</span> <span>QString</span> <span>&amp;</span>dir<span>)</span><span>;</span>\n \n<span>private</span> <span>slots</span><span>:</span>\n    <span>void</span> setup<span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>\n \n<span>private</span><span>:</span>\n    <span>QString</span> m_dir<span>;</span>\n    Crawler <span>*</span>m_crawler<span>;</span>\n<span>}</span><span>;</span></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>which has the following setup:</p>\n\n<div><div><pre>Visualizer<span>::</span><span>Visualizer</span><span>(</span><span>const</span> <span>QString</span> <span>&amp;</span>dir<span>)</span>\n    <span>:</span> <span>QWebView</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>)</span>\n    <span>,</span> m_dir<span>(</span>dir<span>)</span>\n    <span>,</span> m_crawler<span>(</span><span>new</span> Crawler<span>(</span><span>this</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>\n<span>{</span>\n    setFixedSize<span>(</span><span>600</span><span>,</span> <span>600</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>\n    frame<span>-&gt;</span><span>setScrollBarPolicy</span><span>(</span><span>Qt</span><span>::</span><span>Horizontal</span><span>,</span> <span>Qt</span><span>::</span><span>ScrollBarAlwaysOff</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>\n    frame<span>-&gt;</span><span>setScrollBarPolicy</span><span>(</span><span>Qt</span><span>::</span><span>Vertical</span><span>,</span> <span>Qt</span><span>::</span><span>ScrollBarAlwaysOff</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>\n \n    load<span>(</span><span>QUrl</span><span>(</span><span>&quot;qrc:/index.html&quot;</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>\n \n    <span>QWebFrame</span> <span>*</span>frame <span>=</span> page<span>(</span><span>)</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>mainFrame</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>\n    frame<span>-&gt;</span><span>addToJavaScriptWindowObject</span><span>(</span><span>&quot;crawler&quot;</span><span>,</span> m_crawler<span>)</span><span>;</span>\n \n    <span>QFile</span> file<span>(</span><span>&quot;:/bootstrap.js&quot;</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>\n    file.<span>open</span><span>(</span><span>QFile</span><span>::</span><span>ReadOnly</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>\n    <span>QString</span> bootstrap <span>=</span> file.<span>readAll</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>\n    file.<span>close</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>\n    page<span>(</span><span>)</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>mainFrame</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>evaluateJavaScript</span><span>(</span>bootstrap<span>)</span><span>;</span>\n \n    <span>QTimer</span><span>::</span><span>singleShot</span><span>(</span><span>250</span><span>,</span> <span>this</span><span>,</span> SLOT<span>(</span>setup<span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>\n<span>}</span></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Let’s analyze what happens there. First of all, for simplicity we set a fixed window size and therefore we can get away with no scrollbar at all. We also load the main HTML file which embeds webtreemap, right from the resource by using Qt’s compact <a href=\"http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.8/resources.html\">resource system</a>. Like in the <a href=\"http://ariya.ofilabs.com/2011/09/hybrid-webnative-desktop-codemirror.html\">previous CodeMirror demo</a>, this eases the deployment since everything is packaged right with the executable.</p>\n<p>This example’s resource contains the following files:</p>\n<pre>\nindex.html\nwebtreemap.js\nbootstrap.js\n</pre>\n<p>We need <code>webtreemap.js</code> for the webtreemap implementation and the main <code>index.html</code> to be loaded right into the QWebView (or rather, our own subclass). The purpose of <code>bootstrap.js</code> is clear if we look at the contents:</p>\n\n<div><div><pre>crawler.<span>progress</span>.<span>connect</span><span>(</span><span>function</span><span>(</span>count<span>)</span> <span>{</span>\n    document.<span>getElementById</span><span>(</span><span>'progress'</span><span>)</span>.<span>textContent</span> <span>=</span> <span>'Crawling '</span> <span>+</span> count <span>+</span>\n        <span>' directories...'</span><span>;</span>\n<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>\n \ncrawler.<span>finished</span>.<span>connect</span><span>(</span><span>function</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>\n    document.<span>getElementById</span><span>(</span><span>'progress'</span><span>)</span>.<span>style</span>.<span>display</span> <span>=</span> <span>'none'</span><span>;</span>\n    appendTreemap<span>(</span>document.<span>getElementById</span><span>(</span><span>'map'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> JSON.<span>parse</span><span>(</span>crawler.<span>tree</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>\n<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>The first part connects the signal named <code>progress</code> from an object called <code>crawler</code> to the implemented function, which basically just updates the text of an element in the web page, serving as a nice feedback to the user that the crawling is still on going (in particular, if the folder contains thousands of files). If you recall <code>Visualizer</code> constructor, there is a line which calls QWebFrame’s <a href=\"http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.8/qwebframe.html#addToJavaScriptWindowObject\">addToJavaScriptWindowObject()</a> with an instance of the <code>Crawler</code> class, thereby <a href=\"http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.8/qtwebkit-bridge.html#making-qobjects-known-to-javascript-via-qwebframe\">adding a new object</a> to the web page. When that object’s <code>progress</code> is emitted (from the native C++ side), the given JavaScript function (in the web world) is invoked. This demonstrates the <a href=\"http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.8/qtwebkit-bridge.html#using-signals-and-slots\">signal-slot connection</a> from a native QObject to the other side of the bridge.</p>\n<p>The same thing happens with the other signal, <code>finished()</code>, which got emitted when the crawler is completed. This time, we need to supply our webtreemap widget the data. <code>crawler.tree</code> actually comes from a property named <code>tree</code> of that Crawler class again. What it contains is the JSON formatted (in string) data of the entire directory tree which also holds the size of each entry.</p>\n<p>Surprisingly, that’s all the bridging you need!</p>\n<p>All in all, the native part is pretty thin (<a href=\"http://www.dwheeler.com/sloccount/\">sloccount</a> gives around 150 lines), mostly the code to crawl the file system. By leveraging DOM-based webtreemap, in a short time we wrap the result in a nice and interactive visualization.</p>\n<p>Web technologies are nice, aren’t they?</p>"

[...] Hier muss sich die C++-Gemeinde umgewöhnen. Neuerungen wie Lambdas und <code>auto</code> machen C++11 zu einer deutlich produktiveren Sprache, als C++98 es war. Es gilt nun, diese Produktivitätssteigerung im Alltag auch zu nutzen, um gegen Java und .NET zu bestehen.

In particular, KDAB currently does not require extra payment for C++98 support, even though, as this post will make abundantly clear, I personally wouldn’t mind if it did <img alt=\":)\" src=\"http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\"> .</p>\n<p>So, the new C++ standard <a href=\"http://herbsutter.com/2011/08/12/we-have-an-international-standard-c0x-is-unanimously-approved/\">is finalised and voted on unanimously</a>. Does that mean that we’ll have another decade of C++ incompatibilities ahead of us?</p>\n<p>My answer to that is: That depends on us.</p>\n<p>Will we adopt C++11 faster than C++98? Our compilers do. Will we make use of the new productivity gains (<code>auto</code>, range-for, lambdas, …) or will we continue to castrate our code to work with 15-year-old compilers? The answers of the majority of C++ programmers will determine how the next decade goes for all of us.</p>\n<p>In this post, I’ll argue (strongly) for dropping C++98 support asap, and using C++11 to the fullest possible extent in all our projects. This includes dropping support for compilers and platforms that don’t (yet) support C++11 to the extent required by a particular project instead of <code>#ifdef</code>ing our way around it, as we (as an industry) have done for the past 30 years. Will these compilers and platforms be left out in the cold? Not really: they will have older versions of libraries and programs to support them. But yes, newer versions will require an up-to-date C++ compiler.</p>\n<p>Is this realistic? I think it is.</p>\n<p>Essentially, we have this situation already now. Many projects require fairly recent versions of libraries, precisely because 1) there’s not much point in supporting older versions, and 2) supporting many versions of one library with the same code-base is fairly expensive. I’ve tried. Gpgme++ theoretically supports gpgme’s that can be considered stone-aged. Has anyone ever tested this? Hmmm… How many Mac applications still support OS X 10.2? 10.3? 10.4? Half of the web doesn’t work anymore on KDE 3.5′s Konqueror.</p>\n<p>Then why should we be so conservative when it comes to C++, the very core of what we work with? It’s not even customer-visible. Why do we accept an STL shipping in 2011 that is basically unchanged from the mid-1990s? Why do we <code>#ifdef</code> our way around MSVC6 problems in 2011? Why do we care about the quirks of GCC 3.3, or heaven forbid, 2.95?</p>\n<p>My new-year’s resolution (ok, it’s a bit early, but hey): stop it!</p>\n<p>C++11 support in C++ compilers now is much stronger than C++98 support was in 1998 in the then-C++-compilers. I fully expect every C++ compiler to have caught up on final C++11 with its next major release, except for source-code invisible changes like the new memory model. I <em>want</em> Qt 5 to require a C++11 compiler. I <em>want</em> KDE 5 to require a C++11 compiler. I will lobby inside KDAB to do the same.</p>\n<p>Why? Because I’m a programmer, and we’re lazy.</p>\n<p>I <em>want</em> to use <code>auto</code>. If you make me type <code>std::map::const_iterator</code> instead of <code>auto</code>, it’s more work, less fun, so you should need to <em>pay extra</em>.</p>\n<p>I <em>want</em> to use lambdas. If you make me write<br>\n<pre>\r\nstruct ByName : std::binary_function {\r\n    result_type operator()( const Foo &amp; lhs, const Foo &amp; rhs ) const {\r\n        return lhs.name() &lt; rhs.name() ;\r\n    }\r\n};\r\n</pre><br>\ninstead of <code>[](const Foo &amp;lhs, const Foo &amp;rhs) { return lhs.name() &lt; rhs.name() ; }</code>, it’s more work, less fun, so you should need to <em>pay extra</em>.</p>\n<p>C++11 is a much more productive language than C++98. We as an industry can, however, only reap that productivity gain if we stop throwing C++ productivity out of the window by the bucket-load in the hopeless pursuit of compatibility with non-standard implementations. The worst offender, Microsoft, has seen the light. Their current compilers are very standards-compliant, and actively maintained. I hope that Apple won’t be the next blocker: By choosing Clang over GCC for—apparently—political reasons (GCC 4.2 was the last GCC with GPLv2), they have lost at least one year of C++11 support that GCC and VC are ahead of Clang. Let’s hope Clang catches up soon.</p>\n<p>[[EDIT 2011-09-21: If you think that VC isn't implementing C++11 fast enough, you can make yourselves heard here: <a href=\"http://visualstudio.uservoice.com\">http://visualstudio.uservoice.com</a>, in particular <a href=\"http://visualstudio.uservoice.com/forums/121579-visual-studio/suggestions/2202961-support-c-11-features\" title=\"Support C++11 features\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://visualstudio.uservoice.com/forums/121579-visual-studio/suggestions/2089423-c99-support\" title=\"C99 support\">here</a>.]]</p>\n<p>[[EDIT 2012-03-30: Microsoft <a href=\"http://herbsutter.com/2012/02/29/vc11-beta-on-feb-29/\">has announced</a> that the VC++ compiler will have a faster release cycle than Visual Studio. That makes me hope that we'll see a \"reasonably conforming\" (Sutter) VC++ a long time before 2014. Also, Clang++ 3.1 has caught up a lot with GCC (<a href=\"http://clang.llvm.org/cxx_status.html#cxx11\">http://clang.llvm.org/cxx_status.html#cxx11</a>, 3.1 currently shows up as \"SVN\"); it seems tooling will indeed not be the problem, after all.]]</p>\n<br>Filed under: <a href=\"http://marcmutz.wordpress.com/category/programming-languages/c/\">C++</a>, <a href=\"http://marcmutz.wordpress.com/category/programming-languages/c/c0x/\">C++0x</a>, <a href=\"http://marcmutz.wordpress.com/category/english/\">English</a>  <a href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/marcmutz.wordpress.com/431/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/marcmutz.wordpress.com/431/\"></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=marcmutz.wordpress.com&amp;blog=14776649&amp;post=431&amp;subd=marcmutz&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1\" width=\"1\">"

      "content" : "A while ago NVIDIA released drivers with their <a href=\"http://developer.download.nvidia.com/assets/gamedev/files/GL_NV_path_rendering.txt\">NV_path_rendering</a> extension. GL_NV_path_rendering is a relatively new OpenGL extension which allows rendering of stroked and filled paths on the GPU.<br><br> I&#39;ve heard about it before but lately I&#39;ve been too busy with other stuff to look at, well, anything.<br><br> I&#39;ve decided to spend a few seconds looking at the <a href=\"http://developer.nvidia.com/nv-path-rendering-videos\">videos NVIDIA posted on their site</a>. They were comparing the NV_path_rendering, Skia, Cairo and Qt. Pretty neat. Some of the demos were using huge paths, clipped by another weird path and using perspective transforms. Qt was very slow. It was time for me to abandon my dream of teaching my imaginary hamster how to drive a stick shift and once again look at path rendering.<br><br>You see, I wrote the path rendering code so many times that one of my favorite pastimes was creating ridicules paths that no one would ever think about rendering and seeing how fast I could render them. Qt's OpenGL code was always unbelievably good at rendering paths no one would ever render. Clearly these people were trying to outcrazy me.<br><br>Fortunately there's an <a href=\"http://developer.nvidia.com/nv-path-rendering\">SDK posted on the NVIDIA site</a> and it's really well done. It even compiles and works on GNU/Linux. Probably the best demo code for a new extension that I've ever seen. The extension itself is very well done as well. It's very robust, ultimately though it's the implementation that I care about. I have just one workstation with an NVIDIA card in it, a measly Quadro 600, running on a dual processor xeon e5405, but it was enough to play with it.<br><br> The parts using Qt were using the raster engine though. I&#39;ve looked at the code and decided to write something that would render the same thing but using just Qt. The results were a little surprising. Qt OpenGL could render tiger.svg scaling and rotating it at about 270fps, while the NV_path_rendering was running at about 72fps. Here&#39;s both of them running side by side:<br><div><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-gbqRpFeb9dc/TnU5W4p1tQI/AAAAAAAAAD0/L4EX2hi7zF8/s1600/nv_path_renderer_samples.png\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"212\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-gbqRpFeb9dc/TnU5W4p1tQI/AAAAAAAAAD0/L4EX2hi7zF8/s400/nv_path_renderer_samples.png\" width=\"400\"></a></div><br> (numbers lower for both on account of them running at the same time of course). As you can see Qt is almost 4x faster. I&#39;ve figured it might be related to the different SVG implementations and rendering techniques used, so I quickly hacked the demo NVIDIA posted to open a brand new window (you need to click on it to start rendering) and render to QGLPixelBuffer but using the same SVG and rendering code as their NV_path_rendering demo code. The results were basically the same.<br><br>I posted the code for the Qt demo and the patch to nvpr_svg on github: <a href=\"https://github.com/zackr/qt_svg\">https://github.com/zackr/qt_svg</a><br><br>The patch is larger than it should be because it also changed the file encoding on the savedfiles from DOS to Unix but you shouldn't have any issues applying it.<br><br>So from a quick glance it doesn't seem like there are any performance benefits to using NV_path_rendering, in fact Qt would likely be quite a bit slower with it. Having said that NVIDIA's implementation looks very robust and a lot more numerically stable. I've spent a little bit of time looking at the individual pixels and came away very impressed.<br><br>In general the extension is in a little bit of a weird situation. On one hand, unlike OpenVG which creates a whole new API, it's the proper way of introducing GPU path rendering, on the other hand pretty much every vector graphics toolkit out there already implements GPU based path rendering. Obviously the implementations differ and some might profit from the extension but for Qt the question is whether that quality matters more than the performance. Specifically whether the quality improves enough to justify the performance hit.<br><br>I think the extension&#39;s success will largely depend on whether it&#39;s promoted to, at least an EXT or, ideally an ARB, meaning all the drivers support it. Using it would make the implementations of path rendering in toolkits/vector graphics libs a lot simpler and give driver developer a central place to optimize a pretty crucial  part of the modern graphics stack. Unfortunately if you still need to maintain the non NV_path_rendering paths then it doesn&#39;t make a whole lot of sense.Mesa3D implementation would be trivial simply because I&#39;ve already implemented path rendering for OpenVG using the Gallium3D interface, so it&#39;d be a matter of moving that code but I&#39;m just not sure if anyone will be actually using this extension. All in all, it&#39;s a very well done extension but it might be a little too late.<div><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/27901662-3860641722987695055?l=zrusin.blogspot.com\" alt=\"\"></div>"

      "content" : "<img src=\"http://planet.debian.org/heads/hertzog.png\" width=\"65\" height=\"93\" alt=\"\" align=\"right\" style=\"float:right\">  <p>Triaging bugs is one of the easiest way to start <a href=\"http://raphaelhertzog.com/contributing-to-debian/\">contributing to Debian</a>. I’ll teach you the basics in this article.</p>\n<h3>1. Prerequisites</h3>\n<p>All interactions with the Debian Bug Tracking System (BTS) happen through email so you need to have an email account with an address that you’re willing to make public.</p>\n<p>All the mail that you send to the BTS will be archived and publicly available through its <a href=\"http://www.debian.org/Bugs/\">web-interface</a>. This also means that you should have some spam filters in place because it will inevitably be harvested by spammers. <img src=\"http://raphaelhertzog.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":-(\"> </p>\n<p>To ensure that this email address is consistently used by the various tools that we’re going to use, it’s a good idea to put this email address in the DEBEMAIL environment variable. You can also specify your full name in DEBFULLNAME (in case you don’t want to use the name associated with your Unix account). You usually do this by modifying <code>~/.bashrc</code> (if you use bash as login shell):</p>\n<pre>export DEBEMAIL=\"hertzog@debian.org\"\nexport DEBFULLNAME=\"Raphaël Hertzog\"\n</pre>\n<p>You should also install the <a href=\"http://packages.debian.org/devscripts\">devscripts</a> package, it provides the <code>bts</code> command that we’re going to use.</p>\n<h3>2. Find a package or a team with too many bugs</h3>\n<p>You can literally pick any popular software that’s in Debian, they almost always get more bug reports than the maintainers can handle. Instead of picking a package, you can also select <a href=\"http://wiki.debian.org/Teams\">a packaging team</a> and concentrate your efforts on the set of packages managed by the team.</p>\n<p>In any case, it’s important to receive the bug traffic for the packages that you’re going to work on. If you went for a specific package, you should subscribe to the package via the <a href=\"http://packages.qa.debian.org\">Package Tracking System</a> (there’s a subscribe box on the bottom left corner once you selected the source package of interest). If you decided to help a team, there’s usually a dedicated mailing list receiving all bug traffic.</p>\n<p>You can browse a <a href=\"http://qa.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugs-by-source\">list of packages with the most bugs</a> if you have troubles finding a package to work on.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://raphaelhertzog.com/files/2011/09/paper-stack-300x251.jpg\" title=\"A stack of bug reports to triage\" height=\"251\" width=\"300\" alt=\"A stack of bug reports to triage\"></p>\n<h3>3. Triage bugs!</h3>\n<p>Bug triaging is all about making sure that bugs are correctly classified so that when a developer looks at the bug list, he can quickly find bugs with all the information required to be able to fix them!</p>\n<h4>3.1 Adding information to bug</h4>\n<p>Adding supplementary information is easily done just by sending a mail to <em>XXXX</em>@bugs.debian.org (replace XXXX with the bug number).</p>\n<p>But often you want to reply to a message in the bug history, in that case “<code>bts --mbox show <em>XXXX</em></code>” is for you. It will grab the corresponding mailbox and open a mailer (mutt by default) on it. Now you can directly reply in your favorite mailer.</p>\n<h4>3.2 Classifying bugs</h4>\n<p>The Debian BTS uses <a href=\"http://www.debian.org/Bugs/Developer#tags\">tags</a> (click the link and read the doc!) to classify bugs. “<code>bts tag <em>XXXX</em> + <em>foo</em></code>” will add the <em>foo</em> tag (replace the + with a – to remove a tag). If you want to explain why you’re adding a tag, you should instead reply in the bug log as explained above, put control@bugs.debian.org in Bcc (Blind Carbon Copy) and start the body of your message with your tag command:</p>\n<pre>tag <em>XXXX</em> + <em>foo</em>\nthanks\n</pre>\n<p><strong>But what tag should you add?</strong> When a bug is submitted, you should try to reproduce the bug. If you can reproduce it, then tag the bug “confirmed” (example in <a href=\"http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=641710#10\">#641710</a>). If you can’t, you should request more information (ex: a sample document triggering the bug, a configuration file, the output of some relevant command, etc.) until you can reproduce it or conclude that it was a user mistake. When you request supplementary information due to this, you should tag the bug “unreproducible moreinfo” (example in <a href=\"http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=526774#15\">#526774</a>). “moreinfo” should be later dropped when the requested information are provided, and “unreproducible” should be dropped if those information were enough to actually help reproduce the bug (example in <a href=\"http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=526774#32\">#526774</a>).</p>\n<p>During that initial evaluation, it’s also worth differentiating packaging bugs (which are specific to Debian) from upstream bugs (which are relevant also for non-Debian users). The latter should be tagged “upstream” (and forwarded upstream if the bug is reproducible or contains enough information for the upstream developers, example in <a href=\"http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=635112#17\">#635112</a>). </p>\n<p>If you saw a (viable) patch in the bug log, the bug should be tagged “patch”. This is usually done by the patch submitter but sometimes it’s forgotten (example in <a href=\"http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=632460#10\">#632460</a>). Take care though to not reinstate the patch tag if it was initially set but then dropped by the package maintainer after a review of the patch.</p>\n<p>If the title of the bug report is not descriptive enough, you can change it with a “<code>retitle <em>XXXX</em> <em>new-title</em></code>” command (example in <a href=\"http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=170850#10\">#170850</a>).</p>\n<p>You can also change the severity of the bug report depending on the impact of the problem (with a command “<code>severity <em>XXXX</em> <em>new-severity</em></code>”, what a surprise!). Request for new features are “wishlist”, most documentation problems are “minor”. On the other side of the scale, you can use “important” for bugs that are very annoying but that should not block a release. “serious”, “grave” and “critical” are used for <a href=\"http://raphaelhertzog.com/2011/07/14/how-to-squash-debian-release-critical-bugs/\">release critical bugs</a>, check the <a href=\"http://www.debian.org/Bugs/Developer#severities\">official definitions of the severities</a> (examples in <a href=\"http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=502738#10\">502738</a> or <a href=\"http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=506498#10\">#506498</a>).</p>\n<h4>3.3 Closing non-bugs and bugs that are already fixed</h4>\n<p>If your analysis of the bug report is that it’s not really a bug but a user mistake, then you should close it by sending a mail to <em>XXXX</em>-done@bugs.debian.org with some explanations of the user’s mistake so that he can get past his problem (example in <a href=\"http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=592853#10\">#592853</a>).</p>\n<p>If the problem was a real bug, but one that is apparently already fixed, you should try to quickly find the version that fixed the bug. If you can’t find it in the changelog (there’s a link to it in the PTS, or you can use /usr/share/doc/<em>package</em>/changelog.Debian.gz), you’ll make the safe assumption that the upstream version you’re currently using is the first one where this is fixed. Then you send a mail to <em>XXXX</em>-done@bugs.debian.org but you start your mail with “<code>Version: <em>version-that-fixed-the-bug</em></code>” and continue with a small explanation of why you believe the bug to be fixed by this version (example in <a href=\"http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=122948#19\">#122948</a>).</p>\n<h4>3.4 Reassigning misfiled bug reports</h4>\n<p>Bug reports are not always filed against the proper package. Users file bugs against applications where they experience the bugs, but the real bug might be in an underlying library or application.</p>\n<p>When that happens, you should use the “<code>reassign <em>XXXX</em> <em>correct-package</em> <em>version</em></code>” command to get it filed against the correct package. The <em>version</em> parameter is optional but should be provided if possible, it should be the oldest version that we know to have the problem (example in <a href=\"http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=626232#20\">#626232</a>).</p>\n<h4>3.5 Forwarding bugs</h4>\n<p>Forwarding bugs means opening bug reports in the upstream bug tracker for issues that have been reported in Debian but that applies to the upstream (unmodified) source code. Be sure to include all the relevant information and a link to the corresponding Debian bug.</p>\n<p>Depending on the upstream bug tracker, you might have to open an account to be able to file new bug reports.</p>\n<p>On the Debian side, you must record that a bug has been forwarded with “<code>bts forwarded <em>XXXX</em> <em>upstream-bug-url</em></code>”. <em>upstream-bug-url</em> is the URL corresponding to the upstream bug report you created (ex: <a href=\"http://projects.ciarang.com/p/feed2omb/issues/21/\">http://projects.ciarang.com/p/feed2omb/issues/21/</a> recorded in <a href=\"http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=609345#10\">#609345″</a>).</p>\n<p>If the upstream authors fix the bug you reported, you can tag the Debian bug with “fixed-upstream” so that it’s easier to find bugs to close when the next upstream release comes out (example in <a href=\"http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=637275#12\">#637275</a>).</p>\n<h4>3.6 Updating version information</h4>\n<p>The Debian BTS uses “version tracking” to know which package versions are affected by a given bug. It’s particularly important to have correct version information for release critical bugs since it might affect the migration of packages to testing.</p>\n<p>You can learn more on this topic here: <a href=\"http://wiki.debian.org/HowtoUseBTS#Version_tracking\">http://wiki.debian.org/HowtoUseBTS</a>.</p>\n<h3>4. More advice</h3>\n<p>Colin Watson wrote a <a href=\"http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/ucgi/~cjwatson/blosxom/2009/03/02%232009-02-27-bug-triage-rants\">constructive rant</a> explaining some mistakes that bug triagers are often doing.

This book is based on my popular \"<a href=\"http://www.catonmat.net/blog/sed-one-liners-explained-part-one/\">Famous Sed One-Liners Explained</a>\" article series that has been read over 500,000 times.</p>\n<div style=\"padding-top:1em\"><p><a href=\"https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=JE9QVYSJV84NE\"><img src=\"https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/btn/btn_buynowCC_LG.gif\" border=\"0\" name=\"submit\" alt=\"PayPal - The safer, easier way to pay online!\"></a><br>\n<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/scr/pixel.gif\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"></p>\n</div>\n<p>I reviewed all the one-liners in the series, fixed various mistakes, greatly improved the explanations, added a bunch of new one-liners, bringing the total count to 100, and added three new chapters - an introduction to sed, a summary of sed addresses and ranges, and a chapter on debugging sed scripts with sed-sed.</p>\n<h2>Table of Contents</h2>\n<p>The e-book is 98 pages long and it explains exactly 100 one-liners. It's divided into the following chapters:</p>\n<ul><li>Preface.</li>\n<li>1. Introduction to sed.</li>\n<li>2. Line Spacing.</li>\n<li>3. Line Numbering.</li>\n<li>4. Text Conversion and Substitution.</li>\n<li>5. Selective Printing of Certain Lines.</li>\n<li>6. Selective Deletion of Certain Lines.</li>\n<li>7. Special sed Applications.</li>\n<li>Appendix A. Summary of All sed Commands.</li>\n<li>Appendix B. Addresses and Ranges.</li>\n<li>Appendix C. Debugging sed Scripts with sed-sed.</li>\n<li>Index.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What's sed?</h2>\n<p>Sed is the superman of UNIX stream editing. It's a small utility that's present on every UNIX system and it transforms one stream of text into another. Let's take a look at several practical examples that sed can carry out easily. All these examples and many more are explained in the e-book.</p>\n<p>I have also made the first chapter of the book, <i>Introduction to sed</i>, freely available. Please download <a href=\"http://www.catonmat.net/download/sedbook-preview.pdf\">the e-book preview</a> to read it. The introductory chapter explains the general principles of sed, introduces the four spaces of sed, addresses and ranges, and various command line flags.</p>\n<p><strong>Example 1: Replace \"lamb\" with \"goat\" on every line</strong></p>\n<pre>sed 's/lamb/goat/'</pre>\n<p>This one-liner uses the famous <code>s/.../.../</code> command. The <code>s</code> command substitutes the text in the first part of the command with the text in the second part. In this one-liner it replaces \"<code>lamb</code>\" with \"<code>goat</code>\".</p>\n<p>A very detailed explanation of how sed reads the lines, how it executes the commands and how the printing happens is presented in the freely available <a href=\"http://www.catonmat.net/download/sedbook-preview.pdf\">introduction chapter</a>. Please take a look.</p>\n<p><strong>Example 2: Replace only the second occurrence of \"lamb\" with \"goat\" on every line</strong></p>\n<pre>sed 's/lamb/goat/2'</pre>\n<p>Sed is the only tool that I know that takes a numeric argument to the <code>s</code> command. The numeric argument, in this case <code>2</code>, specifies which occurrence of the text to replace. In this example only the 2nd occurrence of \"<code>lamb</code>\" gets replaced with \"<code>goat</code>\".</p>\n<p><strong>Example 3: Number the lines in a file</strong></p>\n<pre>sed = file | sed 'N; s/\\n/: /'</pre>\n<p>This one-liner is actually two one-liners. The first one uses the <code>=</code> command that inserts a line containing the line number before every original line in the <code>file</code>. Then this output gets piped to the second <code>sed</code> command that joins two adjacent lines with the <code>N</code> command. When joining lines with the <code>N</code> command, a newline character <code>\\n</code> is placed between them. Therefore it uses the <code>s</code> command to replace this newline <code>\\n</code> with a colon followed by a space \"<code>: </code>\".</p>\n<p>So for example, if the <code>file</code> contains lines:</p>\n<pre>\nhello world\ngood job\nsunny day\n</pre>\n<p>Then after running the one-liner, the result is going to be:</p>\n<pre>\n1: hello world\n2: good job\n3: sunny day\n</pre>\n<p><strong>Example 4: Delete every 2nd line</strong></p>\n<pre>sed 'n;d'</pre>\n<p>This one-liner uses the <code>n</code> command that prints the current line (actually the current pattern space, see the <a href=\"http://www.catonmat.net/download/sedbook-preview.pdf\">introduction chapter</a> for in-depth explanation), deletes it, and reads the next line. Then sed executes the <code>d</code> command that deletes the current line without printing. This way the 1st line gets printed, the 2nd line gets deleted, then the 3rd line gets printed again, then the 4th gets deleted, etc.</p>\n<p><strong>Example 5: ROT 13 encode every line</strong></p>\n<pre>\nsed '\ny/abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz/nopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklm/\ny/ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ/NOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDEFGHIJKLM/\n'\n</pre>\n<p>Here the <code>y/set1/set2/</code> command is used. The <code>y</code> command substitutes elements in the <code>set1</code> with the corresponding elements in the <code>set2</code>. The first <code>y</code> command replaces all lowercase letters with their 13-char-shifted counterparts, and the second <code>y</code> command does the same for the uppercase letters. So for example, character <code>a</code> gets replaced by <code>n</code>, <code>b</code> gets replaced by <code>o</code>, character <code>Z</code> gets replaced by <code>M</code>, etc.</p>\n<p>Sed is actually very powerful. It's as powerful as a Turing machine, meaning you can write any computer program in it. Check out these programs written in sed. Run them as <code>sed -f file.sed</code>:</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"http://www.catonmat.net/ftp/sed/sedtris.sed\">Tetris</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.catonmat.net/ftp/sed/sokoban.sed\">Sokoban (game)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.catonmat.net/ftp/sed/dc.sed\">Calculator</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.catonmat.net/ftp/sed/turing.sed\">Turing machine</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>After you read the e-book you'll be able to understand all these complex programs!</p>\n<h2>Book Preview</h2>\n<p>See the quality of my work before you buy the e-book.

      "content" : "<div>I have recently been working on a project that requires a 12V supply. Ordinarily this is no problem my selection of bench supplies are generally more than a match for anything I throw at them. </div><div><br></div><div><a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-dYB4_xlqMs0/Tm_QXdTP5OI/AAAAAAAAAFY/7dlp2ij7cfY/s1600/thandar-ts3022s.jpg\"><img src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-dYB4_xlqMs0/Tm_QXdTP5OI/AAAAAAAAAFY/7dlp2ij7cfY/s200/thandar-ts3022s.jpg\" style=\"float:right;margin:0 10px 10px 0;width:200px;height:126px\" title=\"My TS3022S Bench Supply\" alt=\"My TS3022S Bench Supply\" border=\"0\"></a>This project however needed a little more \"oomph\" than usual, specifically 200W more. Funnily enough a precision variable output bench supply capable of supplying 20A are rare and *very* expensive beasties.</div> <div><br></div><div>So we turn to a fixed output supply, after all I will want to run my project without hogging my bench supplies anyway. These can be bought from various electronics suppliers like Farnell from around the £50 mark and Chinese imports from Ebay sellers start around the £20 mark.</div><div><br></div><div>All very well and good but that is money I was not planning on spending and possibly a month of waiting for an already badly delayed project. So I decided to Convert an old ATX PSU into a 12V source. This is not a new idea and a quick search revealed many suitable guides online. I had a quick skim, decided I did understand the general idea and ploughed ahead.</div><div><br></div><div>Wikipedia has a very useful page on the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATX\">ATX standard</a> complete with pinout diagrams and colour codes. The pile of grey box ATX supplies available on my shelf was examined and one was helpfully labelled with a sticker proclaiming 22A@12V and we had a winner.</div><div><br></div><div>Opening the case of the donor 450W CIT branded supply revealed a mostly empty enclosure with the usual basic switching arrangement. I removed most of the wire loom aside from two of each output voltage (3.3V, 5V and 12V i figured the other voltages might be useful in future) and three commons, the 3.3V and 5V sense lines were also kept. Each of these pairs were cut to length and leads were wired to 4mm sockets.</div><div><br></div><div>The \"PWR_EN\" line was wired via a toggle switch to ground so the output can be switched on and off easily. The 5V standby and a 5V output line were wired to a green/red bi-colour LED (via 270Ω current limit resistors) to give indication that mains is present and when the output is on.</div><div><br></div><div>Holes were drilled for four 4mm sockets an indicator LED and a switch.

Which, within the context of Victorian morality, simply meant a woman who (gasp) sought sexual pleasure for her own enjoyment!<br>\n<br>\nHe wrote about these troublesome patients and their treatment in the The American Journal of the Medical Sciences. The paper is a hoot to read, and I recently uploaded a PDF version of the file, which you can download <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/64108136/Cases-of-Nymphomania\">here</a>.<br>\n<br>\nFirst up, is the case of Margaret Murphy, a young, Irish immigrant and unwed mother who sought help for a constant &quot;pricking&quot; sensation in her urethra, as well as a uterine hemorrhage. She also had a great deal of trouble with &quot;micturition&quot; (urination), and her symptoms sounded very much like a typical UTI (urgency, burning, etc.).<br>\n<a name=\"more\"></a><br>\nBut there was another reason for her urinary pain. The good doctors found several suspicious objects in her bladder including: hairpins and a twisted mass of copper wire (don&#39;t try this at home, kids). Turns out the poor woman suffered from the &quot;solitary vice&quot; (masturbation) and had some kind of fetish for urethral stimulation. Nor, did she show any real desire to quit, in spite of numerous hospitalizations. She also denied that what she was doing <i>was</i> masturbation.<br>\n<br>\n But Storer wasn&#39;t the type to be so easily fooled, and he confidently asserted that even though her clitoris wasn&#39;t enlarged (a sure sign of nymphomania/masturbation), she was still a champion wanker: <br>\n<blockquote>\n<i>I am inclined to think that she masturbates, though, as is usual, she denies it. Her manners are those of that habit. Her expression, when unconscious of being observed, is at times decidedly lecherous. </i></blockquote>\nStorer didn&#39;t buy her denials. And he had his reasons. Perhaps, it was the presence of the especially large cork that had somehow made it&#39;s intrepid way into her vagina that had tipped him off. Unfortunately, this cork, which had been forcibly inserted by a bed wrench, turned out to be a real bitch to remove (I can only imagine).<br>\n<blockquote>\n<i>It [the cork]was situated high up in the vagina, very near the os, a little back of and in contact with it, the smaller end being uppermost. &quot;A strong effort was required to start it from its bed.&quot; The cork is now in my possession, and is of the size to fit a large jog. </i></blockquote>\nWell, there was only one proper place for ol' Maggie. The nut house.<br>\n<br>\nHowever, they released her from the lunatic asylum after a few days. And when she <i>again</i> showed up at the doc&#39;s doorstep with the remnants of a silver spoon caught in her snatch, a thoroughly disgusted Storer washed his hands of the whole sordid mess.<br>\n<blockquote>\n<i>As previously stated, the patient was sent to the Lunatic Hospital at South Boston on May 30th; but, to my surprise, she again appeared at my office on Juno'21st, asserting that she had that day been discharged as \"not insane.\" She again complained of pricking in the neighbourhood of the bladder, which was not the case when I last saw her. From this, my expectations that she would return to her old habit seem confirmed. I now refused to deal further with her, believing that merely palliative treatment without proper restraint would be useless</i></blockquote>\n<br>\nThe second case, he mentions, fared a little better. Mrs. B, was a young, 24-year-old married woman, who found herself having <i>very</i> unladylike thoughts when in the presence of a gentleman, and this distressed her enormously.  Also, she liked to fuck her husband  - <i>a lot</i>. Way more than what was considered normal for a woman (or way more than the good doctor was probably getting, and his was the deciding voice in her diagnosis).<br>\n<br>\nShe and her horny hubby had shagged every night of their married life. She enjoyed sex so much she would frequently lose consciousnesses during the act. This didn&#39;t deter her husband in the slightest, he just continued banging away until she either came to or he got off, whichever came first. (Sounds like some of the men I&#39;ve known).<br>\n<br>\nBut Mrs. B was in a little better shape than poor Margaret Murphy. She didn&#39;t keep &quot;impure companions&quot; or masturbate (whew, she dodged a bullet on that one!), she just liked sex too much. However, if she continued her unbridled copulations, she was destined for a padded room. So, Storer got busy with the treatment, which consisted of:<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n1. Total abstinence from husband; if not possible otherwise, by temporary entire separation.<br>\n2. Meat but once in the day.<br>\n3. Brandy and other stimulants not at all.<br>\n4. Novel writing to be given up.<br>\n5. Hair-pillows and mattress in place of feathers.<br>\n6. Cold sponge-bath morning and night.<br>\n7. Cold enemata at night.<br>\n8. Solution of borax applied to the vagina.<br>\n9. Tinctures of henbane, valerian, and lupulin.<br>\n<br>\nGiven the fact that Mrs.B and her hubby had gone at it like rabbits every night of their married life, abstinence proved impossible, and Storer reported Mr. B had to leave town for awhile.<br>\n<br>\nBut Mrs. B complied with treatment, and the good doctor was a little more hopeful that she and Mr. B could learn to control themselves.<br>\n<blockquote>\n<i>...I nqw [sic] consider the case much more hopeful as regards the mental symptoms, which, bowover [sic], will for some time require decided enforcement of very strict laws. Both the wife and the husband must be taught moderation...</i></blockquote>\nReading these case histories really shows how just how much social norms have changed - and yet remained the same. Our current take on female sexuality and dysfunction, in many ways, turns the Victorian ideal of proper womanhood upside down. Back then, people worried if women were <i>too</i> interested in sex; now they worry if they&#39;re not.<br>\n<br>\nHowever, some of the treatments for female sexual dysfunction are almost as wacky as sending a woman to a mental hospital for masturbating. In the movie <a href=\"http://orgasminc.org/\">Orgasm Inc</a>, a woman who is clitorially orgasmic goes through a surgery of questionable safety to have a device implanted in her spinal column  - all so she can have a proper (hands free) orgasm during intercourse. That&#39;s pretty weird.<br>\n<br>\nIt would be great if we could develop an understanding and appreciation of the of the individual nature of human sexuality. That we are all different. And that sex is very important to some people, but not  to others. Every culture has had norms regarding sexual behavior, and I don&#39;t think it would be possible to have no social control on this issue at all. But our culture is obsessed with control, particularly, of female sexuality.<br>\n<br>\n I suspect most of this boils down to economics. At some time in our prehistory, men realized it was economically useful to control women sexually. With the move from a hunter gather society to an agrarian one, children became an economic asset (they could work the farms) and money was transmitted father to son in a private property system. So, women (keepers of the golden egg) had to to be made to tow the sexual line.<br>\n<br>\nNow, Madison Avenue plays on our sexual impulses to sell products, pharmaceutical companies make billions on sexual dysfunction, and politicians get elected based on their abortion stance. The big movers and shakers in our culture have a major stake in what goes on in our bedroom.  But sex is a social loose cannon, and the more we try to control and direct it, the more it veers out of control. One solution would be tolerance, and another would be letting go of our obsession with control, which might make tolerance a real possibility. I don&#39;t think that this is an unrealistic goal, though, given the present reality, it sometimes seems that way.<div><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6782498325785207244-7287030448329344114?l=www.lilithland.net\" alt=\"\"></div><div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/LilithLand?a=mhDx2KRfhlE:H_3f1MfXvEs:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/LilithLand?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/LilithLand?a=mhDx2KRfhlE:H_3f1MfXvEs:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/LilithLand?i=mhDx2KRfhlE:H_3f1MfXvEs:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/LilithLand?a=mhDx2KRfhlE:H_3f1MfXvEs:dnMXMwOfBR0\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/LilithLand?d=dnMXMwOfBR0\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/LilithLand?a=mhDx2KRfhlE:H_3f1MfXvEs:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/LilithLand?i=mhDx2KRfhlE:H_3f1MfXvEs:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/LilithLand?a=mhDx2KRfhlE:H_3f1MfXvEs:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/LilithLand?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/LilithLand?a=mhDx2KRfhlE:H_3f1MfXvEs:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/LilithLand?i=mhDx2KRfhlE:H_3f1MfXvEs:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/LilithLand?a=mhDx2KRfhlE:H_3f1MfXvEs:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/LilithLand?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/LilithLand?a=mhDx2KRfhlE:H_3f1MfXvEs:l6gmwiTKsz0\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/LilithLand?d=l6gmwiTKsz0\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/LilithLand?a=mhDx2KRfhlE:H_3f1MfXvEs:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/LilithLand?i=mhDx2KRfhlE:H_3f1MfXvEs:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/LilithLand?a=mhDx2KRfhlE:H_3f1MfXvEs:TzevzKxY174\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/LilithLand?d=TzevzKxY174\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/LilithLand/~4/mhDx2KRfhlE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

Just think of printing a customer's logo on an invoice.<br><br>Printing an image at a given size in wxWidgets has been a rather difficult task, mainly for the lack of documentation or examples. After some trial and error I found a working solution and I will describe it here. This solution is based on what I described for <a href=\"http://accountingplusplus.blogspot.com/2011/02/printing-text-with-wxwidgets.html\">printing text</a>. You will need to read that post too.<br><br>1 - Load the image in a wxImage object, resize it, convert it to a wxBitmap. You need to resize the image so that you can print it pixel by pixel and obtain a printed image of the desired size. To define the image size you need to know the desired printed size or the image DPI. You can know the printer's resolution using <span style=\"font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace\">wxDC::GetPPI()</span>.<br>Starting from the original image size and the printer's resolution you can compute the new image size and rescale it.<br>If you know the image's DPI you can compute the new image size in pixels using this formula: <br><div style=\"font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace\"><span style=\"font-size:x-small\">newWidth_pixels = printerPPI / imageDPI * originalWidth_pixels</span></div><div style=\"font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace\"><br></div>If you know the printed image's width (in mm) that you want to obtain you can compute the new image size in pixels using this formula:<br><span style=\"font-size:x-small\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace\">newWidth_pixels  =  printedWidth_mm * PPI / 25.4</span></span><br><br>2 - Print the bitmap, making sure that wxWidgets does not resize it. This is the difficult part, since I ended up with a much larger image than what I wanted. The problem is that I set up a user scale with <span style=\"font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace\">wxDC::SetUserScale()</span> and that scale was also applied to the image, enlarging it. The solution is, obviously, to set the user scale to 1 before drawing the bitmap. Here is a function that I use for the purpose (x and y are the print coordinates in mm):<br><br><span style=\"font-size:x-small\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace\">void PrintBitmap( wxDC *dc, const float logUnitsFactor, wxBitmap &amp;bitmap, const float x, const float y )</span><br style=\"font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace\">{</span><br style=\"font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace\">        double xScale, yScale;</span><br style=\"font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace\">        dc-&gt;GetUserScale( &amp;xScale, &amp;yScale );</span><br style=\"font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace\"></span><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace\">        dc-&gt;SetUserScale( 1, 1 );</span><br style=\"font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace\">        dc-&gt;DrawBitmap( bitmap, x*logUnitsFactor*xScale, y*logUnitsFactor*yScale, true );</span><br style=\"font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace\">        dc-&gt;SetUserScale( xScale, yScale );</span><br style=\"font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace\">}</span></span>"

      "content" : "<p>Here is another proof that Qt is not as <a href=\"http://ariya.ofilabs.com/2010/12/ubiqt.html\">ubiqutious</a> as I would like it to be. When I ask around what developers use to develop desktop apps using web technologies (HTML, JavaScript, CSS), the choice is either <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/air/\">Adobe AIR</a> or <a href=\"http://www.appcelerator.com/products/titanium-desktop-application-development/\">Titanium Desktop</a>. Seems that a lot of people overlook Qt and its built-in <a href=\"http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.8-snapshot/qtwebkit-guide.html\">WebKit integration</a>.</p>\n<p>Rather than ranting, I will start a bunch of blog posts which shows how to bring rich web apps into the desktop. This will be the first now. For branding purposes, we will call it <i>hybrid approach</i> because this literally brings web technologies and native solution in the same plate.</p>\n<p>I have talked about this hybrid stuff before at <a href=\"http://ariya.ofilabs.com/2011/05/meego-conf-2011.html\">MeeGo Conf 2011</a> (see the <a href=\"http://sf2011.meego.com/program/sessions/hybrid-apps-native-web-using-webkit\">video</a>) and will do it again for <a href=\"http://ariya.ofilabs.com/2011/09/countdown-to-the-elements.html\">Intel Elements 2011</a>. However, for that matter, I think blog posts still serve as a better written reference. It also gives me a chance to clarify some prejudices, confusions, and myths that some people still have about web technologies.</p>\n<p>For this post, I’ll show you how to implement something like this screenshot:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/LpbShAmNkLj-X1OjfV9BXg?feat=embedwebsite\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Sxwat_taB48/TmF5yrH-gaI/AAAAAAAACLI/5IhJCJG0LzM/s800/cm-mac.png\" height=\"480\" width=\"600\"></a><br>\nIt’s a code editor (supporting JavaScript mode) based on <a href=\"http://codemirror.net\">CodeMirror</a>, an excellent web-based editing widget written using JavaScript and DOM. There are other similar projects out there, for this example I found out that CodeMirror is the easiest to work with. Note that we will use CodeMirror2, a complete <a href=\"http://codemirror.net/internals.html\">rewrite</a> which is way better and faster than the old version of CodeMirror.</p>\n<p>The entire code is available in the usual <a href=\"http://github.com/ariya/X2\">X2 git repo</a> (or <a href=\"http://gitorious.org/ofi-labs/x2\">the alternative repo</a>), look under <code>webkit/codemirror</code> (you <a href=\"http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/\">need</a> Qt 4.6 or later versions). It essentially contains of two major classes, <code>Editor</code> which is the main window representing the application and <code>CodeMirror</code> which is the wrapper around CodeMirror’s JavaScript implementation. The latter is just a subclass of <a href=\"http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.8/qwebview.html\">QWebView</a> where we host CodeMirror actual logic.</p>\n<p>Because we do not want to run CodeMirror from the file system and we want the editor to work even without Internet connection, we use the technique of storing all the necessary content in <a href=\"http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.8/resources.html\">the resource system</a> provided by Qt. This is what <code>assets.qrc</code> all about, i.e. as a central location to find the following:</p>\n<pre>\nindex.html\ncodemirror.js\ncodemirror.css\njavascript.js\ndefault.css\ncobalt.css\nelegant.css\nneat.css\nnight.css\n</pre>\n<p>Many still mistakenly believe that using web technologies means that the app requires constant network connection. This is not necessarily anymore with the said packaging approach. It is important to note that now we can access any of the files stored inside the resource using the special <code>qrc</code> scheme. This is exactly what the constructor is doing, i.e. loading <code>qrc:/index.html</code> right into the web view:</p>\n\n<div><div><pre>CodeMirror<span>::</span><span>CodeMirror</span><span>(</span><span>QWidget</span> <span>*</span>parent<span>)</span>\n    <span>:</span> <span>QWebView</span><span>(</span>parent<span>)</span>\n<span>{</span>\n    load<span>(</span><span>QUrl</span><span>(</span><span>&quot;qrc:/index.html&quot;</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>\n    changeTheme<span>(</span><span>&quot;default&quot;</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>\n \n    m_external <span>=</span> <span>new</span> External<span>(</span><span>this</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>\n    page<span>(</span><span>)</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>mainFrame</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>addToJavaScriptWindowObject</span><span>(</span><span>&quot;External&quot;</span><span>,</span> m_external<span>)</span><span>;</span>\n<span>}</span></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>The main application class, <code>Editor</code>, has all the important code to setup native menu (we have three main menu items: File, Edit, Theme) and file dialog if the user opens a new file or save the text. Of course, when we save to a file, we need to get the text out of our hosted CodeMirror and write it using <a href=\"http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.8/qfile.html\">QFile</a>. This is where we work with <i>bridging</i> the two different worlds: native and web. There is a whole section about <a href=\"http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.8/qtwebkit-bridge.html\">QtWebKit bridge</a> in the Qt documentation.</p>\n<p>Looking at <code>index.html</code>, you would find that the CodeMirror’s editor object is created as (surprise!) <code>editor</code>. Thus, in order to get the content we have to call <code>editor.getValue</code> (see <a href=\"http://codemirror.net/manual.html#config\">CodeMirror manual</a> for the details), hence effectively transferring the data <i>from</i> the web world <i>to</i> the native world:</p>\n\n<div><div><pre><span>QString</span> CodeMirror<span>::</span><span>text</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>const</span>\n<span>{</span>\n    <span>return</span> page<span>(</span><span>)</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>mainFrame</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>evaluateJavaScript</span><span>(</span><span>&quot;editor.getValue()&quot;</span><span>)</span>.<span>toString</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>\n<span>}</span></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>What about the other way around? We could simply evaluate a JavaScript code that sets the editor’s value, e.g. <code>editor.setValue(content)</code>. Rather than passing content as a string (and thus we need to escape it properly), let’s use another nice feature of QtWebKit bridge: built-in <a href=\"http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.8/qtwebkit-bridge.html#accessing-qobjects\">integration with QObject</a>. We setup a simple QObject subclass called as <code>External</code> whose purpose is only to hold a string property:</p>\n\n<div><div><pre><span>class</span> External<span>:</span> <span>public</span> <span>QObject</span>\n<span>{</span>\n    <span>Q_OBJECT</span>\n    Q_PROPERTY<span>(</span><span>QString</span> data READ data<span>)</span>\n \n<span>public</span><span>:</span>\n    External<span>(</span><span>QObject</span> <span>*</span>parent <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>QObject</span><span>(</span>parent<span>)</span> <span>{</span><span>}</span>\n \n    <span>QString</span> text<span>;</span>\n    <span>QString</span> data<span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>const</span> <span>{</span> <span>return</span> text<span>;</span> <span>}</span>\n<span>}</span><span>;</span></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>An instance of this class is inserted into our web page during the construction of CodeMirror class (see the previous code fragment), under the name <code>External</code>. From now on, anytime in the web world we call <code>window.External.data</code>, we would get the same <i>exact</i> value as what we put into the <code>data</code> property of our instance. It is doing what we want to do: transferring the data <i>from</i> the native world <i>to</i> the web world.</p>\n<p>This seems to be complicated but check out at how simple the function finally looks like:</p>\n\n<div><div><pre><span>void</span> CodeMirror<span>::</span><span>setText</span><span>(</span><span>const</span> <span>QString</span> <span>&amp;</span>text<span>)</span>\n<span>{</span>\n    m_external<span>-&gt;</span><span>text</span> <span>=</span> text<span>;</span>\n    page<span>(</span><span>)</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>mainFrame</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>evaluateJavaScript</span><span>(</span><span>&quot;editor.setValue(External.data)&quot;</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>\n<span>}</span></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Arguably, the special function <a href=\"http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.8/qwebframe.html#evaluateJavaScript\">evaluateJavaScript</a> is really critical to this hybrid approach! In addition to assist the bridging, it is also useful to trigger some action in the web world <i>from</i> the native world:</p>\n\n<div><div><pre><span>void</span> CodeMirror<span>::</span><span>undo</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>\n<span>{</span>\n    page<span>(</span><span>)</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>mainFrame</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>evaluateJavaScript</span><span>(</span><span>&quot;editor.undo()&quot;</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>\n<span>}</span>\n \n<span>void</span> CodeMirror<span>::</span><span>redo</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>\n<span>{</span>\n    page<span>(</span><span>)</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>mainFrame</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>evaluateJavaScript</span><span>(</span><span>&quot;editor.redo()&quot;</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>\n<span>}</span></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>This function is also necessary for the theming support. All the styles needed for the different themes are available from the resource (the last few CSS files in the previous list), but we need to activate it (bonus exercise, why the last line dealing with class name is necessary?):</p>\n\n<div><div><pre><span>void</span> CodeMirror<span>::</span><span>changeTheme</span><span>(</span><span>const</span> <span>QString</span> <span>&amp;</span>theme<span>)</span>\n<span>{</span>\n    <span>QWebFrame</span> <span>*</span>frame <span>=</span> page<span>(</span><span>)</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>mainFrame</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>\n    frame<span>-&gt;</span><span>evaluateJavaScript</span><span>(</span><span>QString</span><span>(</span><span>&quot;editor.setOption(&#39;theme&#39;, &#39;%1&#39;)&quot;</span><span>)</span>.<span>arg</span><span>(</span>theme<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>\n    frame<span>-&gt;</span><span>evaluateJavaScript</span><span>(</span><span>QString</span><span>(</span><span>&quot;document.body.className = &#39;cm-s-%1&#39;&quot;</span><span>)</span>.<span>arg</span><span>(</span>theme<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>\n<span>}</span></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Of course, since we use Qt, the same editor example runs beautifully on <a href=\"http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.8/supported-platforms.html\">other platforms</a> (also here showing different color schemes available for CodeMirror):</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/1N4btEAJNXy4y5h3hifTYA?feat=embedwebsite\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-sYbL0B8weEU/TmHGmKd3XdI/AAAAAAAACLc/PERV6A5Z4K0/s800/cm-linux.png\" height=\"450\" width=\"600\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/_IVrByNcX46IOdJwqM4A6Q?feat=embedwebsite\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-3QOVkLTdRB8/TmI-0DJhrgI/AAAAAAAACLw/54noEp8JBPE/s800/cm-windows.png\" height=\"420\" width=\"600\"></a></p>\n<p>With a pretty thin wrapper (<a href=\"http://www.dwheeler.com/sloccount/\">sloccount</a> gives around 250 lines), we bring CodeMirror to the desktop and build a simple editor around it, with menu, file, editing, and theme support. Of course, credits should go to the brave WebKit team, Qt folks, and CodeMirror developers, whose hard work is leveraged in this demo.</p>\n<p>Obviously, being an example, this hybrid editor still lacks a lot of standard features and hence can’t be really used as a killer application. However, if someone wants to pursue the path of productized hybrid app, don’t hesitate to use it as a starting basis.</p>\n<p>This short demo highlights just two points. First, we can package the web content using the <a href=\"http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.8/resources.html\">resource system</a>, thus it does not need to reside as individual files on the disk or even a remote server. Second, transferring the data between the web world and the native world is possible by leveraging the <a href=\"http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.8/qtwebkit-bridge.html\">bridge</a> provided by QtWebKit.</p>\n<p>In the coming installments, hopefully we can explore more about the bridging mechanism. Of course, feel free to propose a specific topic or concern that you want me to tackle first!</p>"

I'll\nignore some parts which aren't too interesting to an average user at the moment,\nto keep this post as consise as possible. Apart from that, I hope I'm able to\nput all the relevant data into one spot.</p>\n<p>Let us start our little journey in the kernel. There, in a directory named <a href=\"http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git;a=tree;f=drivers/gpu;hb=HEAD\" title=\"GPU drivers in the kernel\"><tt>gpu</tt></a> you'll find the <tt>drm</tt>\ndirectory, which contains all <acronym title=\"Direct Rendering Manager\">DRM</acronym> drivers. In this post, we'll\nfocus on those. The drivers in that directory are the kernel side of the\n<em>Direct Rendering Infrastructure</em> (DRI) and are responsible for managing\nconcurrent access to the graphics hardware. They also provide interfaces to pass\ncommands and data to the <acronym title=\"Graphics Processing Unit\">GPU</acronym>. The <a href=\"http://dri.freedesktop.org/wiki/DRM?action=recall&amp;rev=9#head-9a4fbb54ab27825d29bdc9f523c81e34aa54d27b\" title=\"DRI Wiki: DRM\">DRI wiki explains the three main purposes</a> of the DRM\nmodules.</p>\n<p>The DRM module is also the part that decides whether <acronym title=\"Kernel Mode-setting\">KMS</acronym> or <acronym title=\"User Mode-setting\">UMS</acronym> is used. Other acronyms you might hear\nwith regard to graphics acceleration on Linux and are referring to the Kernel\npart are:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><acronym title=\"Graphics Execution Manager\">GEM</acronym>: an\n    Intel-developed memory management system for GPUs.</li>\n  <li><acronym title=\"Translation Table Maps\">TTM</acronym>: refers to the\n    memory management system used by almost all non-Intel drivers (e.g. AMD's\n    Radeon drivers). The TTM interface is \"GEM-ified\", meaning it\n    offers the same <a href=\"https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/API\" title=\"Wikipedia: application programming interface\">API</a> as GEM.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Apart from that, every driver has its hardware-specific parts like utilizing\npower-saving functions of the respective GPUs, loading firmware, if required,\netc.</p>\n<p>Now we move from Kernel space to user land. We'll ignore any non-X and\nnon-Mesa parts (like acceleration for TTYs). That means, that our next\nGPU specific part is most likely the <acronym title=\"Device Dependent X\">DDX</acronym>. (Please note, that the classic DDX\nmight be replaced by a Gallium3D state tracker, currently that would be the\n<em>xorg</em> state tracker, but <em>xorg</em> will be replaced by <em>XA</em>.\nThis is only an option if the Gallium driver for your GPU supports one of those\nstate trackers, see <a href=\"http://wiki.x.org/wiki/GalliumStatus\" title=\"X.Org Wiki: Gallium Status\">the Gallium status page</a> for further\ndetails.) The DDX for your GPU offers plain (2D) X acceleration on your\nhardware. The respective DDX' are generally named <em>xf86-video-[NAME]</em>,\nwhere <tt>[NAME]</tt> is replaced by e.g. <em>ati</em> or <em>intel</em>. The\nDDX decides which X acceleration paths are available. Acronyms you might hear,\nreferring to the DDX part of the graphics stack, are:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>EXA: even though it looks like an acronym, <a href=\"http://wiki.x.org/wiki/Development/Documentation/Glossary?action=recall&amp;rev=12#EXA\" title=\"X.Org Wiki: Glossary\">the X.Org wiki Glossary defines it as</a>:\n    <blockquote>\n    <p>acceleration architecture with no well-defined acronym</p></blockquote>\n    EXA superseded the older <acronym title=\"XFree86 Acceleration Architecture\">XAA</acronym> and offers 2D\n    acceleration, often in conjunction with <a href=\"https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/XRender\" title=\"Wikipedia: XRender\">XRender</a>.\n  </li>\n  <li>UXA: more or less EXA for Intel GPUs.</li>\n  <li>GLX: actually not a part of the DDX, but an extension for X. It provides\n    a way to draw with OpenGL into an window managed by X.</li>\n  <li><abbr title=\"X Resize, Rotate and Reflect\">XRandR</abbr>: An extension for\n    X which needs to be supported by the DDX to work. It offers a standardized\n    way to set up (multiple) heads (e.g. resolution, position, rotation,\n    etc.).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We're almost through: the last important part is the 3D acceleration offered\nby a Mesa driver. Mesa drivers come in two flavours: classic (e.g. all Intel\ndrivers which are supported by Intel) and Gallium3D-based (like the drivers for\nRadeon chips from the R300 onwards). The difference here is, that the Gallium3D\ndrivers try to share as much code as possible (and thus simplify writing a new\ndriver supporting many platforms, systems and technologies), while the classic\ndrivers are specific to certain platforms, chips, and technologies. They share\nmuch less code among each other. All parts of Mesa need direct access to the\ngraphics hardware (DRI)</p>\n<p>The Mesa drivers use the 3D pipeline of the GPUs for accelerated drawing,\neven for non-3D applications like video acceleration (recently <acronym title=\"Video Decode and Presentation API for Unix\">VDPAU</acronym>, <abbr title=\"XVideo Motion Compensation\">XvMC</abbr> and <acronym title=\"Video Acceleration\">VA</acronym> support were added to Gallium3D, driver\nsupport followed quickly). Otherwise the Mesa drivers are mainly used for\nOpenGL acceleration. Users of OpenGL include scientific programs, <acronym title=\"Computer Aided Design\">CAD</acronym> and – of course – games.</p>\n<p>This concludes our little journey through the various parts of the Linux\ngraphics stack. I hope it helps in understanding the building blocks.</p>"

      "content" : "<img src=\"http://planet.debian.org/heads/mako.gif\" width=\"65\" height=\"93\" alt=\"\" align=\"right\" style=\"float:right\">  <p>I often hear criticism of \"negative campaigning\" in the free software\nmovement. For example, in reply to a <a href=\"http://mako.cc/copyrighteous/20090109-00.comment\">blog post I once wrote</a> about\nan FSF campaign, several people argued against, \"negative campaigning\nof any sort, in any realm.\" Drawing an analogy to political <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smear_campaign\">smear\ncampaigns</a>, some members of the free software community have taken\nthe position that <a href=\"http://castrojo.wordpress.com/2009/01/09/badvista-declares-pyrrhic-victory/#comment-745\">negative campaigning in general is not useful</a>\nand that negativity has no place in our advocacy.</p>\n<p>First, it is important to be clear on what we mean by a negative\ncampaigns. I believe that there is a fundamental difference between\nspeaking out against policies or actions and smear campaigns that\nemploy untrue claims, ad hominem attacks, and that attempt to avoid a\nreal conversation about issues. I will categorically condemn the\nlatter form of smear campaigning in campaigns for software freedom or\nfor anything else.</p>\n<p>That said, negativity directed at negativity has had a positive effect\nin many social movements. I have supported and participated in\n\"negative\" campaigns against proprietary software, software patents,\nDRM, centralized network services, and the firms behind these\npractices. I've done so because I believe that if one is taking an\nethical position, it is justified, and often necessary, to not only\nspeak about the benefits of freedom but against acts of dispossession\nand disenfranchisement.</p>\n<p>In some of the most effective social movements, unambiguously negative\nmessages have been central. Should a campaign for abolishing child\nlabor talk only about how valuable adult workers are to their\nemployers or how happy kids are when they don't work?  Should a\ncampaign trying to abolish land mines talk only about the benefits of\nbomb-free fields and intact lower limbs?  Should a free speech\norganization only speak out about the social welfare brought by a free\npress and never against acts of censorship? These may seem like\noutlandish comparisons but you can find people writing, only a couple\ncenturies ago, about how slavery should be abolished by arguing in\nfavor of the benefits of paid labor.  Even if the economic arguments\nin favor of paid work are strong, these arguments seems irrelevant and\noffensive today.  Whether slavery is more or less efficient is a moot\npoint. Society has rejected it because it is wrong.</p>\n<p>We have made important strides toward eliminating injustices like\nchild labor and slavery because activists waged decidedly negative\ncampaigns against them and convinced others to join in opposition. In\ndoing so, activists declared the status quo unconscionable and created\nan ethical responsibility to find alternatives and to <a href=\"http://mako.cc/copyrighteous/20101017-00\">redefine what\nwas \"realistic.\"</a> While I will not suggest that the movement for\nsoftware freedom is comparable in ethical weight to these other\ncauses, I know that the free software mission is similar in kind.</p>\n<p>Of course, if one does not think that user control over technology is\nan ethical issue but is instead merely a matter of choice, one will\nprobably oppose negative campaigns. It is also possible that a\nparticular negative campaign is tactically unwise in that it is\nunlikely to reach a large audience, unlikely to change people's minds,\nor be difficult to carry out successfully. But such campaigns are a\nbad idea because they are ineffective, not because they are\nnegative. Additionally, a movement that is purely negative and offers\nno reasonable alternative to the stated ill may also be unlikely to\nsucceed. This is why, for example, I believe it is good that the FSF\nuses the large majority of its resources in the \"positive\" role of\nsupporting free software.</p>\n<p>For those that do treat technological empowerment as an ethical ideal,\nit is both justified and essential to condemn the systematic\ndisempowerment of others through non-free software just as we\ncelebrate the benefits of software freedom. \"Negative\" campaigns\nagainst proprietary software, software patents, and DRM in music have\nalready led our community to important -- if incomplete --\nvictories. The desire to right wrongs has been a critical part of our\nmovement's success and of many others'. We would be wise not to give\nit up.</p>"

I always feel insulted when sites ask me that. As if I can’t be trusted to know my own email address. It also doesn’t make sense in the era of the browser ‘auto-fill’ which fills out this information for me.</p>\n<p>After my complaints I received a bunch of other complaints from readers and decided to share these with you web designers and developers. Hope it helps in designing your next web form. Here is our list of 10 things (+ one bonus) you really should and shouldn’t do in a web form:</p>\n<p><strong>1: don’t ask people to re-type email addresses</strong><br>\nThe one I started my day with. Don’t ever make me re-enter my email address in a web form! My browser auto-fills it for me and I can type just fine. Use javascript to check syntax but don’t act like I can’t type. It is annoying for me and signals “people visiting this website are stupid”.</p>\n<p><strong>2: Do enable auto-fill</strong><br>\nMake sure your text fields have names my browser can understand so it can auto-fill those forms. Make the name of the email address field “email” and the telephone number field “telephone”. That way, when people enter their names, the browser fills out the rest of the form with the correct information. Saves us all a lot of trouble.</p>\n<p><strong>3: Don’t disable copy pasting</strong><br>\nSome smart-ass developers add a few lines of javascript to a webform that disables the copy and paste function. This is extremely annoying. I might be entering information in more than one form (like booking a hotel and a flight to get there) and will be copy pasting the important info to and from both forms. If you do this to users you should be ashamed of yourself. Don’t screw with my browser functions! </p>\n<p><strong>4: How likely is it that I’m 0?</strong><br>\nThis one comes from <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/112554148723499466074\">Nico</a> <a href=\"http://lumma.de/\">Lumma</a> who writes: “if you ask for my age, don’t use the current year as a default, it is unlikely that I was just born this year”. That is a very good point. You can still include the years up until today but why not find out the average age of all your users and pre-select that one?</p>\n<p><strong>5: How many members do you have in Afghanistan?</strong><br>\nJudging from most web forms the majority of web surfers live in Afghanistan. They offer a country drop-down list and sort it by Alphabet and Afghanistan is the first country on the list. That is the easy way out, I get it. But why not offer your top 20 or 30 countries at the top of the list and allow people to scroll down for more?</p>\n<p><strong>6: No spaces or – in drop down lists!</strong><br>\nWhen I open up one of those 255 country names in one drop down lists I don’t scroll down to find ‘netherlands’ somewhere down the list. I just type ‘ne’ and the browser preselects the first country down the list that starts with those characters. That is, unless someone thought it would be a great idea to add  a few spaces or dashes before every country to line things out. Please, -don’t -go -there…</p>\n<p><strong>7: Not long enough is too short</strong><br>\nMy name is “Boris Veldhuijzen van Zanten”. Pretty long name, I know. My sisters first name is “Ellemijn” so that one is even longer. Some Brazilian names are even 40 or 50 characters long. That means that at websites like Apple’s and Twitter, which have max-length’s of 20 characters, I get no further than “Boris Veldhuijzen va”. That sucks. And it sucks for more people than you would think. Why not just limit it to 255 characters?</p>\n<p><strong>8: A different state of mind</strong><br>\nIf you are an internationally focused company (and who isn’t if you have a site on the WORLD wide web) making “State” a mandatory field and neglecting that countries other than the US might not need this is very annoying. Some forms reset after you choose a country other than the US, which is fine. Even better; just make it optional.</p>\n<p><strong>9: Don’t use an unreadable, ultra-long captcha</strong><br>\nSpam is annoying but also a small nuisance. Don’t move the problem from your inbox to your clients web form. Is it really that bad to delete a few spam emails from your inbox every day? Worse enough to trouble your customers with that annoying captcha? I personally hate those Google captchas that make we squint and tilt my head and guess at what they display. </p>\n<p><strong>10: we ♥ UTF8</strong><br>\nWouldn’t it be cool if Björk Guðmundsdóttir, 毛泽东先生 and Борис Николаевич Ельцин wanted to become your clients? So why piss them off and don’t offer UTF8 support for their special character sets? It really doesn’t take much extra effort to make your site <a href=\"http://unicode.org/\">UTF8</a> compatible. Ask your developer for help if you don’t know what this means. </p>\n<p><strong>Bonus point: Don’t ignore mobile users</strong><br>\nA lot of forms are (almost) unusable for mobile browsers due to long dropdown / checkbox lists and the overuse of complicated javascript validation. Visit your website with your iPhone or iPad and try to sign-up or buy something. Is it possible? Is it easy? More and more people are using iPads and Android phones to order stuff and sign-up for services. Don’t shut them out.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107992967798752473693\">Gerard van Enk</a> also suggested that if you design forms or deal with customers and members you should check out <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-personal-names\">this w3 page</a>. It has some helpful tips on how you should ask for peoples names. It is all much more complicated than you think but also a lot of fun to find out how different cultures deal with family names. It will make you think twice about asking people for first and last names…</p>\n<p>Got more annoyances or ideas for improving forms? Spit it out in the comments. (I sure hope that our comment form doesn’t suck!)</p>\n<p><em>Photo credit: <a href=\"http://www.shutterstock.com/pic.mhtml?id=72212161\">Dmitriy Shironosov</a> via <a href=\"http://www.shutterstock.com/\">Shutterstock</a>.</em></p>\n<div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheNextWeb?a=ZN2RXOOVRdM:d5fgOyPX5z8:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheNextWeb?i=ZN2RXOOVRdM:d5fgOyPX5z8:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheNextWeb?a=ZN2RXOOVRdM:d5fgOyPX5z8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheNextWeb?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheNextWeb?a=ZN2RXOOVRdM:d5fgOyPX5z8:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheNextWeb?i=ZN2RXOOVRdM:d5fgOyPX5z8:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheNextWeb/~4/ZN2RXOOVRdM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

It was more fun than I had guessed!</p>\n<p>The event worked: we squashed bugs. Geoffrey Thomas (geofft) organized it as an event for MIT's student computing group, SIPB. In this post, I'll review the good parts and the bad. I'll conclude with beaming photos of my two mentees and talk about the bugs they fixed.</p>\n<p>So, the good:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Attendance</strong>. As <a href=\"https://luke.faraone.cc/\">Luke</a> put it, when he arrived, there was hardly anyone there.  “Then people showed up! And then mentorship and pedagogy happened!” In all, 14 people attended, seven of whom are active in Debian or its derivatives (Ubuntu, Debathena).</li>\n<li><strong>We took photos</strong>. Arthur took a wide panoramic photo, and I snapped a few good ones, too. (Thanks to Jessica McKellar for letting me borrow her camera.) Here's my <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulproteus/sets/72157627510089068/with/6076878743/\">full photo set</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Good, free pizza</strong>. Props to geofft for ordering from <a href=\"http://beautys-pizza.com/\">Beauty's</a>, and props to SIPB for picking up the tab.</li>\n<li><strong>We fixed bugs</strong>! I mentored two new Debian contributors through their first release-critical bug fix. Both of them said they would attend similar events in the future. One of my mentees is now idling and asking questions in the #debian-mentors IRC channel.</li>\n<li><strong>The Debian Events team republished the event</strong>. MadameZou <a href=\"http://www.debian.org/events/2011/0821-debub-bsp\">posted</a> the event to debian.org, giving it a nice stable URL.</li>\n<li><strong>geofft made a good list of bugs to work on</strong>. He worked from the release-critical bug list, categorized the bugs by expected difficulty, and made somee short notes about how to fix the bug. This turned out quite useful.</li>\n<li><strong>People printed music to the speakers</strong>. If this sounds weird, you should read the <a href=\"http://sipb.mit.edu/doc/using-sipbmp3/\">SIPB documentation for how to use Gutenbach</a> (written by <a href=\"http://lizdenys.com/\">Liz Denys</a>).</li>\n<li><strong>We had a good ratio of developers to newcomers</strong>. This was hugely helpful; from what I saw, new people rarely waited very long for their questions to be answered. Thanks to Luke Faraone, Sam Hartman, Obey Arthur Liu, Karl Ramm, and Christine Spang from Debian, and Geoffrey Thomas from Debathena, for sharing knowledge.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The event was a success, but as always, there are some things that could have gone more smoothly. Here's that list:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>We hadn't prepared for people to do Debian development on Ubuntu</strong>. In particular, it took Luke and me about half an hour to come up with a pbuilder command line that worked.</li>\n<li><strong>We didn't contribute to Ubuntu, just Debian</strong>. I actually think this is fine, but geofft did originally <a href=\"http://www.debian.org/events/2011/0821-debub-bsp\">want people to work on both</a>. He was disappointed, and we could have managed to do that if we had done more prep.</li>\n<li><strong>We could have reached more prospective attendees</strong>. I know earlier in the year, <a href=\"http://rhydd.org/\">daf</a> organized a highly popular Debian packaging tutorial <a href=\"http://pika.mit.edu/\">elsewhere on campus</a>. I didn't see any of those people at the event, and I think some would have attended if they had known about it.</li>\n<li><strong>Some people wanted a bit more context</strong>. In particular, attendees asked me about what makes a bug release-critical and what it means to do a non-maintainer upload. We could have taken some time to explain these to the whole group; instead, we dove right into hacking. Because we had so many mentors, I think people did get their questions answered, but we can't sustain that if the event grows in size.</li>\n<li><strong>Mentees didn't always get high-quality help</strong>. geofft suggested Jessica work on one bug, and when she had a question, she asked Luke Faraone. Luke wasn't familiar with the bug, and he skimmed it, not realizing that the bug changed issues midway through the bug log. As a result, his initial help was unhelpful. After Luke, Jessica, and the bug were on the same page (so to speak), Jessica received clear, sound answers to questions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Still, it turned out well! I did three NMUs, corresponding to three patches submitted for release-critical bugs by my two mentees. Those mentees were:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://asheesh.org/pub/image/debian-bsp/6076850459_b49d2fb456.jpg\" alt=\"Jessica enjoying herself\" height=\"281\" width=\"500\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://jesstess.com/\">Jessica McKellar</a> is a software engineer at <strike>Ksplice</strike> Oracle and a recent graduate of MIT's EECS program. She solved three release-critical bugs. This was her first direct contribution to Debian. In particular:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?archive=no&amp;bug=636201\">#636201</a>:  While updating the package for multiarch support, the maintainer of  wildmidi presumably made a typo. A single character was missing from a  \"Replaces:\" declaration in debian/control. This bug caused upgrades to  fail. Sam Hartman uploaded an NMU based on a patch Jessica  prepared.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=626420\">#626420</a>: The scribus-doc package failed to build from source due to a missing build-depends entry. This one was super easy, and served as a good test package for setting up and using pbuilder.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=565000\">#565000</a>: The switch to \ngcc-4.5 left hubbub unable to build from source due to new GCC warnings that made -Wall fail on the source, although it would succeed with earlier versions of the package. This led to long philosophical discussions about the particularly most reasonable fix: removing -Wall, or adding a more specific exception.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Jessica has since gotten involved in the <a href=\"https://launchpad.net/~twisted-dev/+archive/ppa\">Twisted project's personal package archive</a>. Toward the end of the sprint, she explained, \"I like fixing bugs. I will totally come to the next bug squashing party.\"</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://asheesh.org/pub/image/debian-bsp/6077392890_95567b4bd3.jpg\" alt=\"Noah grinning\" height=\"500\" width=\"281\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wiki.mako.cc/Noah_Swartz\">Noah Swartz</a> is a recent graduate of Case Western Reserve University  where he studied Mathematics and played Magic. He is an intern at the MIT Media Lab where he contributes to <a href=\"http://www.media.mit.edu/resenv/doppellab/\">DoppelLab</a> in Joe Paradiso's <a href=\"http://www.media.mit.edu/research/groups/responsive-environments\">Responsive Environments</a> group. This was definitely his first direct contribution to Debian. It was also one of the most intense command-line experiences he has had so far. Noah wasn't originally planning to come, but we were having lunch together before the hackathon, and I convinced him to join us.</p>\n<p>Noah fixed <a href=\"http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=625177\">#625177</a>, a fails-to-build-from-source (FTBFS) bug in nslint. The problem was that \"-Wl\" was instead written in all lowercase in the debian/rules file, as \"-wl\". Noah fixed that, making sure the package properly built in pbuilder, and then spent some quality time with lintian figuring out the right way to write a debian/changelog.</p>\n<p>That's a wrap! We'll hopefully have one again in a few months, and before that, I hope to write up a guide so that we run things even more smoothly next time.</p>"

They have a relatively long and colorful history of doing this, and have nowadays been approaching multiple target devices despite limited resources and for example the losing of Openmoko Inc. in 2009. I've been using Debian on my <a href=\"http://wiki.debian.org/DebianOnFreeRunner\">Neo FreeRunner</a> phone for over two years now, and over <a href=\"http://losca.blogspot.com/2008/07/neo-freerunner-does-music-gps-internet.html\">three years</a> of FreeRunner use altogether. FSO2, the next generation freesmartphone.org stack, is finally coming into Debian now, extending the basic phone support besides Openmoko phones to eg. Palm Pre, Nexus One, Nokia N900 and a few HTC phones. It needs a lot of tweaking and eg. a proper kernel, but still.\n<br>\n<br>Four years after beginning of sales of the first Openmoko device (Neo1973), we're still in the pioneering phase of free distributions for mobile phones. There is no \"Ubuntu for phones\" so to speak, not for even a selected models. Meanwhile, like so often in the wide world, competing free software approaches have arrived. Android is the obvious one, and has seen <a href=\"https://code.google.com/p/android-on-freerunner/\">a port to Neo Freerunner</a> among else. Android is not as open a project as one could like, and replaces everything we've known with its own code, but nevertheless it requires to be noted and is completely usable in its free software form. But since there are limitations to its approach, and since it's more of an own separate world from the rest of Linux distributions, it is not as interesting to me as the others in the long run, at least in its current shape.\n<br>\n<br>A more similar competitor to FSO and distributions using FSO is <a href=\"http://www.meego.com/\">MeeGo</a> and its middleware, and to be more precise so far specifically Nokia's efforts on it. Obviously there is the strong competitor for the best general population smartphone of the year, the Qt based <a href=\"http://swipe.nokia.com/\">Nokia N9</a>, but its default software is more of a proprietary thing even though it has a neatly rock solid free software foundation with separate free/non-free repositories and all that. Nice and great for the (GNU/)Linux in general, but the Harmattan software is not exactly on topic for this blog post. It's however in my opinion the best marketing to vendors around the world GNU/Linux + Qt can get as Android Linux has been taking most of the limelight. But meanwhile, with significantly smaller focus and resources, Nokia has also been sponsoring to try to create a truly community based mobile phone software stack at the MeeGo upstream, nowadays called <a href=\"http://wiki.meego.com/N900\">\"MeeGo Community Edition\" or MeeGo CE</a> for short. It co-operates with the <a href=\"https://meego.com/devices/handset\">MeeGo Handset</a> target of MeeGo (and Intel) that hasn't got actual target consumer hardware at the moment, although that might change soon (?), but has been doing some nice applications recently. CE has the target hardware and additional device specific and non-specific software cooking. It used to target Nokia N900 only, but nowadays the project has added N950 (the for-developers-only phone) and N9 to the targets, and it is starting to seem there should be no showstoppers to bring MeeGo CE (or other distributions later on) to them, despite some earlier doubts. A few needed bits to void the warranty we all want to do are still missing, though, but coming. After that it's just developing free software. Usual caveats about specifics of a few kernel drivers apply, as the devices were not designed with the sole purpose of free software drivers in mind. Hopefully mobile 3D gets into a better shape in the coming years, but that's another story.\n<br>\n<br>MeeGo (CE) smartphone middleware, of course, shares nothing with FSO <span style=\"font-size:85%\">*)</span>. While FSO is a \"handle everything\" in itself with its wide variety of daemons, MeeGo consists of more separate software like Intel's and Nokia's <a href=\"http://ofono.org/\">oFono</a> for modem support. FSO demo UIs and SHR UIs have traditionally focused on using <a href=\"http://enlightenment.org/\">Enlightenment 17</a> for its suitability to low power machines, while in MeeGo everything is written in Qt. As Qt/QML is becoming faster and faster, and it's very powerful to write, there might be quite a bit of useful software emerging from there also for other distributions besides MeeGo itself. Actually, there is already a <a href=\"http://wiki.debian.org/Teams/PkgMeeGo\">Debian MeeGo stack maintainer group</a> available, although it hasn't yet focused on the UIs as far as I can see (if I'll have free time I'll join the effort and see for myself in more detail). There is also the QtMoko distribution, based on the original, canceled Trolltech/Nokia Qt Extended (Qtopia) project, but ported to newer Qt:s and put on top of Debian.\n<br>\n<br><span style=\"font-size:85%\">*) Although, correct me if I'm wrong and I might be, the Nokia N900 isi modem driver in FSO was ported/learned from oFono.</span>\n<br>\n<br>MeeGo CE is not only a project to bring a proper MeeGo distribution to a few smartphones, but also to shake out bugs in the MeeGo project's contributions and community processes. It is acting as a completely open MeeGo product contributor, and investigating how things should be optimally done so that everything gets integrated into the MeeGo properly, and that proper MeeGo software releases can be done for the target devices. Therefore it's also an important project for the vitality of the whole MeeGo.\n<br>\n<br>MeeGo CE has so far had <a href=\"http://wiki.meego.com/ARM/N900#Organization\">a whole team</a> in Nokia working on it, but for obvious strategy related reasons community cannot rely on it lasting forever. The real hurdle is for the wider free smartphones community to be ready for really embracing a project that is already a community project but to outsiders might seem like a company project. I believe it's never easy to grow a volunteer community if the starting setup is a paid company team, but it mainly requires a) the interested people and b) the few smart ones to take control and communication responsibility so that it's not anymore seen as a company project. MeeGo CE never was a traditional company project, everything being done in the open and together with volunteers, but I just know how people perceive these things by default. People tend to assume stuff as someone else's responsibility\n<br>\n<br>Whatever happens, I hope there are enough people interested in free software for mobile phones to carry on all these different approaches to the software needed. I hope MeeGo / MeeGo CE will have a great future, and I hope that both the middleware like FSO and MeeGo's components, and the UIs like FSO, SHR, QtMoko and MeeGo Handheld UIs continue to develop. I also hope other distributions like Debian will gather a strong suite of packaged software for smartphones. I know I have had some hard time to find suitable apps for my phone at times.\n<br>\n<br>For those interested about how I use Debian as my mobile phone OS, see <a href=\"http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/User:TimoJyrinki\">http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/User:TimoJyrinki</a>\n<br>\n<br><div><img src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/31939153-3672025321610286290?l=losca.blogspot.com\" alt=\"\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"></div>"

      "content" : "<p>After the release of the OpenGL 4.1 specification the Khronos Group slowed down the pace a little bit but they didn’t left OpenGL developers without a new specification version for too long as a few weeks ago they’ve released OpenGL 4.2. The new version of the specification brings several API improvements as well as exposes some important pieces of hardware functionality that makes OpenGL 4.x class hardware a great step forward in GPU history. This article aims to present the newly introduced features in the latest version of the OpenGL specification and, as a few months ago I wrote an article about <a title=\"Suggestion for OpenGL 4.2 and beyond\" href=\"http://rastergrid.com/blog/2010/11/suggestions-for-opengl-4-2-and-beyond/\">Suggestions for OpenGL 4.2 and beyond</a>, I will write a few words about how does the new specification reflect my forecast.</p>\n<p><span></span></p>\n<h2>New features in OpenGL 4.2</h2>\n<p>OpenGL 4.2 finally filled the holes in the capability matrix of Shader Model 5.0 hardware with some long waited extensions from which some of the functionalities were actually already accessible through cross-vendor and vendor specific extensions. Also, the new version of the specification brings some important API improvement extensions and GLSL constructs that continue the transition to a more easy to use state and shader management.</p>\n<h3><a title=\"GL_ARB_texture_compression_bptc\" href=\"http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/ARB/texture_compression_bptc.txt\">ARB_texture_compression_bptc</a></h3>\n<p>This extension adds the new block compression texture formats called BC7 and BC6H in Direct3D terminology. The extension is actually available for quite some time, since the release of OpenGL 4.0 but now it became core. The formats provide high quality block compression for fixed point RGBA and sRGB textures as well as two floating point texture compression formats for signed and unsigned data.</p>\n<p>Traditional block compression methods (as S3TC or RGTC) use the gradients in a block of pixels which works fine for smooth images but does provide poor results in case of sharp edges. BPTC solves the issue by dividing blocks into multiple partitions which are compressed using independent gradients thus providing better overall quality.</p>\n<p>When comparing compression efficiency, BPTC has a compression ratio of 3:1 compared to 6:1, 4:1 and 2:1 that are the compression ratios of the S3TC DXT1, S3TC DXT5 and RGTC formats respectively.</p>\n<h3><a title=\"GL_ARB_compressed_texture_pixel_storage\" href=\"http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/ARB/compressed_texture_pixel_storage.txt\">ARB_compressed_texture_pixel_storage</a></h3>\n<p>This is an interesting extension that solves a problem that I didn’t even know is such a big issue. The extension is designed primarily to support compressed image formats with fixed-size blocks as that of BPTC as an example. The application can use this extension to configure pixel store parameters so that subtexture operations can provide consistent results in all cases.</p>\n<h3><a title=\"GL_ARB_texture_storage\" href=\"http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/ARB/texture_storage.txt\">ARB_texture_storage</a></h3>\n<p>This is again an interesting extension that provides API improvement over how texture storage is allocated in classic OpenGL. As we all know, OpenGL was always too ad hoc on resource management, from the point of view of when actual resources are allocated for a particular API primitive. This is especially a problem in case of textures where we potentially talk about large amount of data. In classic OpenGL the driver could not know from the beginning for example whether the application will need mipmaps for the texture or how many levels are required. This could easily result in bad allocation patterns and/or large reallocations. This extension introduces the concept of immutable texture images where all the levels are allocated up-front for a texture object.</p>\n<h3><a title=\"GL_ARB_transform_feedback_instanced\" href=\"http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/ARB/transform_feedback_instanced.txt\">ARB_transform_feedback_instanced</a></h3>\n<p>This extension extends the so called “AutoDraw” feature by providing instanced “AutoDraw”. This means that geometry captured using transform feedback can be rendered multiple time using geometry instancing. This is actually a feature that even D3D11 does not provide and being such, I didn’t even think that hardware supports it, even though I think the list usage patterns of the extensions is most probably pretty narrow.</p>\n<h3><a title=\"GL_ARB_base_instance\" href=\"http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/ARB/base_instance.txt\">ARB_base_instance</a></h3>\n<p>This extension is actually the feature I called <strong>ARB_instanced_arrays2</strong> in my <a title=\"Suggestions for OpenGL 4.2 and beyond.\" href=\"http://rastergrid.com/blog/2010/11/suggestions-for-opengl-4-2-and-beyond/\">suggestion list</a>. The extension provides three new draw commands, one is kind of illy named as <strong>DrawElementsInstancedBaseVertexBaseInstance</strong>, even though this command can be called the “basic” indexed draw commands that specifies all parameters. Also, the parameter list of the indirect indexed draw command is extended with the base instance parameter. Fortunately, however, the ARB chosen to add new commands rather than a <strong>SetBaseInstance</strong>-style state specifier command to introduce the new concept. Funnily this feature was missing for a long time as, as far as I know, it is supported by all GPUs capable of doing instanced drawing, and is available in D3D as well.</p>\n<h3><a title=\"GL_ARB_shader_image_load_store\" href=\"http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/ARB/shader_image_load_store.txt\">ARB_shader_image_load_store</a></h3>\n<p>This is where things get start really interesting. This new extension is the ARBified version of the extension <a title=\"GL_EXT_shader_image_load_store\" href=\"http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/EXT/shader_image_load_store.txt\">EXT_shader_image_load_store</a> which fortunately didn’t make it into core in its current form.</p>\n<p>The extension provides GLSL built-in functions allowing shaders to load from, store to, and perform atomic read-modify-write operations to a single level of a texture called an image from any shader stage. Also, the extension indirectly enables the same set of operations for buffer objects by using buffer textures. This enables developers to implement more sophisticated algorithms using shaders that require more complex data structures than just plain arrays.</p>\n<p>This, together with atomic counters that we will talk about later, enables the possibility to implement append/consume buffers and rendering techniques like AMD’s Order-Independent Transparency (OIT) algorithm as <a title=\"OIT and Indirect Illumination  Using DX11 Linked Lists\" href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/hgruen/oit-and-indirect-illumination-using-dx11-linked-lists\">presented at GDC10</a>.</p>\n<p>As the introduction of the new write operations to fragment shaders besides the traditional framebuffer writes makes the execution of the shader have side effects and thus sensitive to whether early-Z is used or not by the hardware, so the extension also provides a mechanism to force or disable early-Z in the fragment shader.</p>\n<p>A similar issue is in case of vertex shaders as the post-transform cache may be no longer valid in case of certain usage patterns of load/store images so, based on how smart the shader compiler is, the post-transform cache could be easily disabled in case a vertex shader uses load/store images resulting in downgraded performance, so care must be taken when using read/write images in vertex shaders as OpenGL does not have any mechanism to help these issues (but I actually have a proposal that I’ll talk about in a future article).</p>\n<p>The API of this extension is greatly improved compared to the EXT version, especially when dealing with various texture image formats. The extension also provides a future-proof DSA-style API. Further, the ARB version of the extension supports loads from any texture format and corrected some specification bugs of the EXT version.</p>\n<p>From hardware implementation point of view, it must be noted that in case a shader contains atomic operations applied to a particular read/write image the driver uses a different hardware path, as required by atomic read-modify-writes so that care must be taken to use atomic operations only when necessary. Also note that this decision is made statically at compile time by the driver so even a single atomic operation in an unlikely taken branch will result it degraded performance. This is another reason why to use atomic counters to implement append/consume buffers instead of using read/write image atomics.</p>\n<h3><a title=\"GL_ARB_shader_atomic_counters\" href=\"http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/ARB/shader_atomic_counters.txt\">ARB_shader_atomic_counters</a></h3>\n<p>This the other long waited feature that I also suggested and was still missing from OpenGL but was available in D3D11. The specification was actually ongoing for a long time now (about a year) and it even appeared for a while in AMD’s OpenGL drivers sometimes as EXT, sometimes as ARB extension. The extension provides API to access a number of hardware atomic counters that provide efficient counter operations on a GPU global scale. Atomic counters come handy in many cases like append/consume buffers or indirect draw buffer construction.</p>\n<p>The extension provides access to these atomic counters from GLSL and also makes it possible to back them up with buffer objects so after OpenGL draw calls the value of the counters is preserved in these buffers for later use.</p>\n<p>The OpenGL implementation is superior compared to D3D’s as it provides access to atomic counters from all shader stages, with caveats of course as, it was mentioned in the previous section, the side effects made possible with read/write images and atomic counters require special care in case of fragment and vertex shaders as they may result in invalid rendering and/or lower performance.</p>\n<p>On hardware vendor implementations, it must be noted that atomic counters are much, much more faster than read/write image atomics, at least on AMD hardware which has dedicated hardware for atomic counters. On NVIDIA hardware, though, it seems that there is no different hardware path for atomic counters as their performance is roughly the same as in case of read/write image atomics.</p>\n<p>The dedicated hardware implementation of atomic counters, however, comes with a trade-off as the number of atomic counters is severely limited on AMD hardware, but one can still use read/write image atomics if ran out of atomic counters.</p>\n<h3><a title=\"GL_ARB_conservative_depth\" href=\"http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/ARB/conservative_depth.txt\">ARB_conservative_depth</a></h3>\n<p>This is another extension I’ve suggested and that fills another functionality hole compared to D3D11. The extension is actually an ARBified version of <a title=\"GL_AMD_conservative_depth\" href=\"http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/AMD/conservative_depth.txt\">AMD_conservative_depth</a> that extends the application developer’s control over eary depth and stencil tests. <a title=\"GL_ARB_shader_image_load_store\" href=\"http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/ARB/shader_image_load_store.txt\">ARB_shader_image_load_store</a>  already provides a way to force or disable eary-Z and this extension provides further modes that provide a hint to the driver about how depth is modified in a fragment shader that outputs depth. This passes enough information to the GL implementation to activate some early depth test optimizations safely while still preserving the ability to account the final depth value in the depth test.</p>\n<p>The extension exposes the new capability in the form of fragment shader input layout qualifiers called “depth_any”, “depth_greater”, “depth_less” and “depth_unchanged”. The interesting ones are the one that assume a greater or less depth value as output and provide the ability to early reject groups of fragments using Hi-Z and early-Z even when depth is modified. This technique can greatly improve the rendering performance of volumetric particles, decals and billboards.</p>\n<p>As far as I can tell, though, the extension provides performance benefits only the AMD hardware currently as NVIDIA hardware does not have such functionality thus using the extension would still force NVIDIA GPUs to disable early-Z in case the fragment shader outputs a depth value, but future hardware may change this.</p>\n<h3><a title=\"GL_ARB_shading_language_420pack\" href=\"http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/ARB/shading_language_420pack.txt\">ARB_shading_language_420pack</a></h3>\n<p>This is a strangely named extension that provides a lot of improvements to GLSL. These are mostly API improvements only, but have a great value when looking at source code maintainability and resource management.</p>\n<p>I think the most useful addition of the extension is the “binding” layout qualifier that I referred to as ARB_explicit_sampler_location and ARB_explicit_uniform_block_index in my <a title=\"Suggestions for OpenGL 4.2 and beyond.\" href=\"http://rastergrid.com/blog/2010/11/suggestions-for-opengl-4-2-and-beyond/\">suggestion list</a>. This enables shader writers to explicitly bind a uniform block binding index to a uniform block as well as explicitly bind sampler, texture and image binding points to a sampler or image variable.</p>\n<p>Besides that, the extension adds other minor improvements, like implicit conversion of return values of functions, UTF-8 character set support, C-style initializer list support and scalar swizzle operators.</p>\n<h3><a title=\"GL_ARB_internalformat_query\" href=\"http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/ARB/internalformat_query.txt\">ARB_internalformat_query</a></h3>\n<p>This is another kind of strangely named extension that was meant to provide the possibility to query information about the internal format of textures, however, it actually failed it as it provides only the ability to query the maximum number of samples available for different texture formats.</p>\n<p>The extension was ambitious as it planned to provide internal format information like the ability to query the actual internal format used, whether the format is renderable, accessible in a particular shader stage, whether it can be used as read/write image, and even to provide performance hint about using a particular texture internal format. Unfortunately all these were left for a future extension.</p>\n<h3><a title=\"GL_ARB_map_buffer_alignment\" href=\"http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/ARB/map_buffer_alignment.txt\">ARB_map_buffer_alignment</a></h3>\n<p>This is the last new extension introduced in OpenGL 4.2 that trivially adds the requirement to the pointer returned by buffer mapping commands that they provide a minimum of 64 byte alignment to support processing of the data directly with special CPU instructions like SSE or AVX. This can provide further performance increase when client is modifying buffer data.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>OpenGL 4.2 again proven that OpenGL is not dead, but in fact plans to be again the ultimate choice of 3D API by pushing the exposed hardware capabilities over the line set by D3D11. When thinking about the list of expected extensions I presented in my earlier article, <a title=\"Suggestions for OpenGL 4.2 and beyond\" href=\"http://rastergrid.com/blog/2010/11/suggestions-for-opengl-4-2-and-beyond/\">Suggestions for OpenGL 4.2 and beyond</a> we can see that OpenGL 4.2 fulfilled all my expectations and even my wish list was partly fulfilled, but here’s the list for a better overview:</p>\n<p><strong>My expectations for OpenGL 4.2:</strong></p>\n<pre style=\"background-color:#ccffcc\"><strong>GL_EXT_shader_image_load_store</strong>\n<span>- added in the form of GL_ARB_shader_image_load_store</span></pre>\n<pre style=\"background-color:#ccffcc\"><strong>GL_ARB_shader_atomic_counters</strong>\n<span>- added as is</span></pre>\n<pre style=\"background-color:#ccffcc\"><strong>GL_ARB_instanced_arrays2</strong>\n<span>- added in the form of GL_ARB_base_instance</span></pre>\n<pre style=\"background-color:#ccffcc\"><strong>GL_ARB_explicit_sampler_location</strong>\n<span>- added in the form of GL_ARB_shading_language_420pack</span></pre>\n<pre style=\"background-color:#ccffcc\"><strong>GL_ARB_explicit_uniform_block_index</strong>\n<span>- added in the form of GL_ARB_shading_language_420pack</span></pre>\n<p><strong>My personal wish-list for OpenGL 4.2:</strong></p>\n<pre style=\"background-color:#ffcccc\"><strong>GL_ARB_draw_indirect2</strong>\n<span>- still missing, though partly available though <a title=\"GL_AMD_multi_draw_indirect\" href=\"http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/AMD/multi_draw_indirect.txt\">GL_AMD_multi_draw_indirect</a></span></pre>\n<pre style=\"background-color:#ffcccc\"><strong>GL_ARB_direct_state_access</strong>\n<span>- still missing, however, there is hope that it will be included in the next release where the ARB plans to rewrite the whole structure of the core specification</span></pre>\n<pre style=\"background-color:#ccffcc\"><strong>GL_NV_texture_barrier</strong>\n<span>- not in core but it is implicitly subsumed by GL_ARB_shader_image_load_store, they say</span></pre>\n<pre style=\"background-color:#ccffcc\"><strong>GL_AMD_conservative_depth</strong>\n<span>- added in the form of GL_ARB_conservative_depth, despite lack of NVIDIA support</span></pre>\n<pre style=\"background-color:#ffcccc\"><strong>GL_ARB_texture_gather_lod</strong>\n<span>- still missing, because of lack of supporting hardware</span></pre>\n<pre style=\"background-color:#ffcccc\"><strong>GL_NV_copy_image</strong>\n<span>- still missing, even though it could be a good API improvement</span></pre>\n<pre style=\"background-color:#ffcccc\"><strong>GL_EXT_texture_filter_anisotropic</strong>\n<span>- still missing, as I was informed, because of patent issues</span></pre>\n<pre style=\"background-color:#ffcccc\"><strong>GL_ARB_shader_stencil_export</strong>\n<span>- still missing, most probably because of lack of NVIDIA hardware support</span></pre>\n<pre style=\"background-color:#ffcccc\"><strong>GL_AMD_depth_clamp_separate</strong>\n<span>- still missing, most probably because of lack of NVIDIA hardware support</span></pre>\n<pre style=\"background-color:#ffcccc\"><strong>GL_AMD_transform_feedback3_lines_triangles</strong>\n<span>- still missing, most probably because of lack of NVIDIA hardware support</span></pre>"

The <i>only</i> release available in the Linux distro will be the OpenJDK. </p>\n\t<p>While I am glad to see Oracle pushing the free JDK, I am a bit concern by this sudden decision. There are still bugs (for example, with fonts, applets or other <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=48758\">others issues</a>) present in the OpenJDK which does not happen in the sun-java6 packages.<br>\nAnd also, as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/gnu_andrew/status/106594550822342656\">Andrew John Hughes said on Twitter</a>, the Oracle proprietary JVM just lost one of the two freedoms it had (free to redistribute the software)...</p>\n\t<p>Moreover, many people are still using the proprietary JVM.

I originally intended for this code to go inside of compiz in a neater fashion so it would be available to all plugins, however we are past feature freeze in our release schedule and ABI breaks are no longer allowed unless there’s a good reason for them.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://smspillaz.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/minimized-windows.png\"><img title=\"minimized-windows\" src=\"http://smspillaz.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/minimized-windows.png?w=640&amp;h=343\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"343\"></a></p>\n<p>In order to do this, we have to use some interesting hacks to ensure that windows are not completely unmapped when they are minimized, mainly using XShape to remove their input and inhibiting paint with the compositor. This means that some applications aren’t going to play nice with it, and we need to know what they are, so that we can either blacklist them or decide whether or not we want to ship with this functionality. So please report bugs if you get oddities like input not working in your applications, or your cursor being grabbed while an application is “minimized”!</p>\n<br>  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/smspillaz.wordpress.com/813/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/smspillaz.wordpress.com/813/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/smspillaz.wordpress.com/813/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/delicious/smspillaz.wordpress.com/813/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gofacebook/smspillaz.wordpress.com/813/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/facebook/smspillaz.wordpress.com/813/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gotwitter/smspillaz.wordpress.com/813/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/twitter/smspillaz.wordpress.com/813/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/smspillaz.wordpress.com/813/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/stumble/smspillaz.wordpress.com/813/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/smspillaz.wordpress.com/813/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/digg/smspillaz.wordpress.com/813/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/smspillaz.wordpress.com/813/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/reddit/smspillaz.wordpress.com/813/\"></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=smspillaz.wordpress.com&amp;blog=1094742&amp;post=813&amp;subd=smspillaz&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">"

However, I think that with a little more improvement in the LLVM bindings, it shouldn’t be any trouble to write a simple compiler in an afternoon.</p><p>There are LLVM bindings for many other languages including Python and Ruby. So it’s possible to build a similar compiler in the language of your choice. One advantage of doing this in a compiled language, such as Haskell, is that I can statically link in the JIT compiler and can run scripts in our toy language at native speeds without needing the LLVM toolset installed. (However, the compiler executable is 18M, but you get what you pay for)</p><p>One particularly interesting use for such a compiler would be for generating and running JIT code in Python or Ruby. That way you could have the performance of a compiled language when you needed it, but the convenience of a scripting language for everything else.</p><p> </p><p> </p> <div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/atomic_spin?a=9fXoLefBBXI:rx1ObrYq0bg:dnMXMwOfBR0\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/atomic_spin?d=dnMXMwOfBR0\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/atomic_spin?a=9fXoLefBBXI:rx1ObrYq0bg:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/atomic_spin?i=9fXoLefBBXI:rx1ObrYq0bg:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/atomic_spin?a=9fXoLefBBXI:rx1ObrYq0bg:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/atomic_spin?i=9fXoLefBBXI:rx1ObrYq0bg:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/atomic_spin?a=9fXoLefBBXI:rx1ObrYq0bg:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/atomic_spin?i=9fXoLefBBXI:rx1ObrYq0bg:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/atomic_spin?a=9fXoLefBBXI:rx1ObrYq0bg:cGdyc7Q-1BI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/atomic_spin?d=cGdyc7Q-1BI\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/atomic_spin/~4/9fXoLefBBXI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

The article <a href=\"http://doc.qt.nokia.com/qq/qq13-apis.html\">Designing Qt-Style C++ API</a> from Matthias 6 years ago is still a good reading till today. The content itself is now expanded into the wiki page <a href=\"http://developer.qt.nokia.com/wiki/API_Design_Principles\">API Design Principles</a>.</p>\n<p>The major premise behind a good API is rather straightforward:</p>\n<blockquote><p>the code is usually <b>written once</b> but <b>read many times</b>.</p></blockquote>\n<p>When writing the code, the developer has the time she needs to look at the API documentation and digest it. When someone else reads the code (for review or bug fix), she may not always have the API documentation handy. While this is just common sense, wait until you finish reading and see why this important fact is still overlooked these days.</p>\n<p>Note: Qt is in C++, but surprisingly the same API design principles apply to the (wonderful) world of JavaScript, which is the focus in this blog post.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/George_Boole.jpg\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Boole\">George Boole</a>, inventor of the Boolean logic.</p>\n<p>For this particular discussion, I’ll pick my favorite API design mistake: <b>boolean trap</b>. On <a href=\"http://developer.qt.nokia.com/wiki/API_Design_Principles#e7794937cba47d5e9c54d50a6a32328b\">this topic</a>, the above API Design Principle wiki page says that</p>\n<blockquote><p>it’s almost invariably a mistake to add a bool parameter to an existing function</p></blockquote>\n<p>Let’s start with the textbook example: guess what this code means?</p>\n\n<div><div><pre>widget.<span>repaint</span><span>(</span><span>false</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Without looking at the documentation, the usual suspect is <b>don’t repaint the widget</b>. Then, you look at the documentation and it refers the function argument as <code>immediate</code>, which is <code>true</code> if you want immediate painting or <code>false</code> for deferred painting. Thus, the correct behavior implied by the above code is actually <b>repaint this widget later</b>, which is  miles away from your initial guess.</p>\n<p>One possible solution to this problem is to use explicit function argument. In the C++ world, this can be solved using enum, e.g. <code>widget.repaint(WidgetClass::Deferred)</code>. In the JavaScript world, the alternative is using an object literal such as,</p>\n\n<div><div><pre>widget.<span>repaint</span><span>(</span><span>{</span> immediate<span>:</span> <span>false</span> <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>or the more verbose variant:</p>\n\n<div><div><pre>widget.<span>repaint</span><span>(</span><span>{</span> mode<span>:</span> <span>&quot;immediate&quot;</span> <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>or just create a different function for that purpose:</p>\n\n<div><div><pre>widget.<span>repaintLater</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>There will be a concern of performance since an object is more expensive than just a simple boolean literal. Thus, profile your code carefully and set a sensible compromise if this above line is in your hot path. On the other hand, I also do believe that modern future JavaScript engines would be smart enough to optimize such usages that the speed penalty is negligible.</p>\n<p>Another classic is the <b>confusion during construction</b>. Your user interface needs a bunch of sliders to allow the user to choose some values. Here is one line in the code for you to review:</p>\n\n<div><div><pre><span>var</span> opacitySlider <span>=</span> <span>new</span> Slider<span>(</span><span>true</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Mysteriously, there are also lines similar to:</p>\n\n<div><div><pre><span>var</span> volumeSlider <span>=</span> <span>new</span> Slider<span>(</span><span>false</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>It turns out that <code>true</code> there means a horizontal slider and <code>false</code> means a vertical slider. Of course, the easiest way to clear this confusion is to actually name the object <code>HorizontalSlider</code> and <code>VerticalSlider</code> and get rid of the boolean argument. Heck, who knows someday you’ll need a diagonal slider!</p>\n<p>You may scream, &quot;Of course, I won’t be too idiot to make those rookie mistakes!&quot;. Well, in the following paragraphs I’ll give examples of <b>actual</b> boolean traps in the API of several well-known JavaScript libraries and frameworks out there (I try to be unbiased). Consider that there are <i>millions</i> of developers using the libraries in real-world web applications, imagine the exposure of the traps.</p>\n<p>For each of this case, imagine you are doing a code review. Your amazing coworker wants to commit a patch and he consults you to check your opinion.</p>\n<h3>to be or not to be</h3>\n<p>This is the same as the textbook example, but coming from a real framework:</p>\n\n<div><div><pre>stackView.<span>updateHeight</span><span>(</span><span>false</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Yes, that <code>false</code> again refers to <i>immediate or not</i>. To the untrained developer, the above line feels like <b>don’t update the height</b>. A real crazy one might even stretch it to <b>update the width</b>!</p>\n<p>Here is another one. To facilitate easy iteration of child widgets, you can use <code>next()</code> function which would get you the next sibling. But then, the code looks like:</p>\n\n<div><div><pre>widget.<span>next</span><span>(</span><span>true</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>which actually does the extra magic (because of the <code>true</code> value) that the very first child widget will be returned if you hit the last one. In other words, <code>true</code> there stands for <code>circular</code>. An innocent value which does too much behind your back. Well, good luck trying to review that kind of code.</p>\n<p>Another dangerous venture:</p>\n\n<div><div><pre>widget.<span>destroy</span><span>(</span><span>false</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>which potentially leads you to think <b>don’t destroy this widget</b>. You can’t be more wrong, the function actually still destroys your widget, but it leaves the DOM associated with the widget intact. Only if the argument is <code>true</code> then actually every related DOM pieces is also <s>tore</s> torn down.</p>\n<h3>optionally undecipherable</h3>\n<p>Now that we have the slider for the UI, we need to preset the value:</p>\n\n<div><div><pre>volumeSlider.<span>setValue</span><span>(</span><span>90</span><span>,</span> <span>false</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Another boolean horror! The documentation reveals that <code>false</code> there indicates that the slider should <i>not animate</i> the movement of its indicator from the old value to the new value. By default, it will show the animation but since we want to set the initial value, the animation will be distracting and needs to be off. How about writing it like this instead?</p>\n\n<div><div><pre>volumeSlider.<span>setValue</span><span>(</span><span>90</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span> animation<span>:</span> <span>false</span> <span>}</span> <span>)</span><span>;</span></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>There is this list view of all your customers. We want to find out who live in a certain city. Can you guess what the last optional argument refers to?</p>\n\n<div><div><pre>customerView.<span>filter</span><span>(</span><span>'address'</span><span>,</span> <span>'sunnyvale'</span><span>,</span> <span>false</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Oh, apparently the API documentation refers it to <code>caseSensitive</code>! Just by looking at it, this is not obvious and it could mean an entirely different thing, anything from <code>exactMatch</code> to <code>highlightMatchedLine</code>. One possible workaround:</p>\n\n<div><div><pre>customerView.<span>filter</span><span>(</span><span>'address'</span><span>,</span> <span>'sunnyvale'</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span> caseSensitive<span>:</span> <span>false</span> <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></pre></div></div>\n\n<h3>the more, the merrier</h3>\n<p>While <i>one</i> boolean argument is already confusing, <i>two</i> boolean arguments can’t be more fun.</p>\n<p>To handle layout, often there is a line of code that looks like:</p>\n\n<div><div><pre>cmp.<span>setCentered</span><span>(</span><span>true</span><span>,</span> <span>false</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Again, a trip to the API doc enlightens the reviewer that the function signature is actually <code>setCentered(centered, autoUpdate)</code>. This is confusing as <code>setCentered(centered)</code> only is probably fine, it’s just like a property setter, but the interplay of the <code>autoUpdate</code> argument forces the brain to think harder.</p>\n<p>Note that a pair of values like that, especially in the context of centering/geometry purpose, might provoke a different interpretation: <b>center vertically and horizontally</b>. This is arguably the most sensible one which comes to mind if one sees that code.</p>\n<p>Here is another one:</p>\n\n<div><div><pre>menu.<span>stop</span><span>(</span><span>true</span><span>,</span> <span>false</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>The boolean values there refer to <i>clear the animation queue or not</i> and <i>go to the animation or not</i>, respectively. They are not even remotely related. What is your best educated guess if you did not know this beforehand?</p>\n<p>Of course, why stop at two if you can have more?</p>\n\n<div><div><pre>event.<span>initKeyEvent</span><span>(</span><span>&quot;keypress&quot;</span><span>,</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span> <span>null</span><span>,</span> <span>null</span><span>,</span>\n    <span>false</span><span>,</span> <span>false</span><span>,</span> <span>false</span><span>,</span> <span>false</span><span>,</span> <span>9</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></pre></div></div>\n\n<h3>double negative</h3>\n<p>Now, coming back to property setter, this is one valid use of boolean argument, e.g. <code>dialogBox.setVisible(true)</code>. However, care must be taken so that there is no such <b>double negative</b>. Especially for non-native speakers, double negative requires an extra careful measure to make sure that the right meaning is communicated.</p>\n<p>If I wake you at midnight and ask you this question &quot;if invisible is false, does that mean my component is shown or hidden?&quot;, there is a chance you answer it incorrectly.</p>\n<p>Real-world examples of double negative follow:</p>\n\n<div><div><pre>volumeSlider.<span>setThumbsDisabled</span><span>(</span><span>false</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>\ncomponent.<span>setDisabled</span><span>(</span><span>false</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>\nfilter.<span>setCaseInsensitive</span><span>(</span><span>false</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Would you be less confused if this is what you read instead?</p>\n\n<div><div><pre>volumeSlider.<span>setThumbsEnabled</span><span>(</span><span>true</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>\ncomponent.<span>setEnabled</span><span>(</span><span>true</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>\nfilter.<span>setCaseSensitive</span><span>(</span><span>true</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>The same principle applies to active vs inactive, modified vs unmodified, defined vs undefined, selected vs unselected, etc.</p>\n<p>By now, hopefully you got the idea of various risky uses of boolean argument. Feel free to share your favorite freak-out moment as you encounter such a similar trap.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, next time you design an API function, remember <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Boole\">George Boole</a> and don’t let him down!</p>\n<p><b>Update</b>: Some people on <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/jt5dc/hall_of_api_shame_boolean_trap_its_almost/\">Reddit</a> pointed out that they would not interpret <code>widget.repaint(false)</code> as <i>do not repaint</i>. First of all, it’s subjective. In some languages it can be understood as <i>repaint not</i>, which is effectively a negation. Also, the context might pollute, e.g. if there is <code>fooWidget.show(false)</code> (which means <i>do not show</i>) right before, then it may influence a similar conclusion for the repaint issue. I was also not clear that any crazy possible interpretations are just examples, substitute them with your own imaginations. The fact that everyone can propose a different interpretation is the premise: ambiguity begets insanity.</p>"

Let's summarize\nwhere I was at that moment:\n<ul>\n<li>31 years old\n</li><li>married for 7 years, 2 kids and a soon-to-born 3rd\n</li><li>still working as Head of Mechanical Testing Lab at Onera\n</li><li>running a BBS named BuBulle System\n</li><li>Member of Fidonet (IIRC, even Network Coordinator for 2:320)\n</li><li>Having a great Lantastic 1Mbps network between my BBS machine\n(running DesqView/386, that so wonderful multitasking software, aha\n</li><li>Tons of friends in the BBS world\n</li><li>Most of them using MS-Dos with pirated software at home\n</li><li>A friend named René Cougnenc\n</li></ul>\nWe're in 1992. Magali is about to come. Three children, from 0 to 4. I'm getting bored of these BBS\nthings. OK, I did fun things like translating (eh) the documentation\nof Frontdoor a Fidonet node system written by a norwegian dude.\n<p>\nBut, still. Among my BBS friends, René is now playing regularly with a\nstrange thing coming from Finland. This is pretty much like these\nmysterious \"Unix\" machines I hear about, sometimes at Onera, ran by\nstrange wizards that often look like hippies from the 70's\n(hey...these were my youth years). I also have these few friends from\nthe BBS world who are also playing with these thingies.  Ollivier,\nnoticeably, who is using of these mysterious @frmug.fr.net \"email\"\naddresses, from his PC running 386BSD (what? A PC not running those\nwonderful MS-DOS programs?  How weird).\n</p><p>\nRené is apparently playing with another tribe. He often talks about\nan evolution of Minix written by a Finnish student, which is available\nwith source code, just like René programs. René is also a member of\nthat FrMug tribe, the FRench Minix Users Group, who are comunicating\nwith \"newsgroups\" that are apparently similar to what we're doing with\nour BBS....but apparently more funnily hackish...and most often in\nthat mysterious \"U**x\" world. \n</p><p>\nAh, that thing is called Linux. You can download it by FTP on \"the\nInternet\". But I don't have \"the Internet\". Oh, sure, we have this\nthing called BitNet at work, I even have what they call \"an email\naddress\" as perrier@froner81.bitnet. We can maybe do things with\nthat.\n</p><p>\nAh yes, there are funny tools that allow \"downloading\" files on \"FTP\"\n(WTH is that?) servers but doing that by mail. You receive dozenes of\nmails \"uuencoded\" (WTH is that? I'm not using Unix, I'm using\nDos...but, eh, it works, still).\n</p><p>\nOh, fun, I now downloaded a full set of disks (14....I need to find 14\nfloppies, doh!) of something called Slackware. Apparently, a crazy\nfreak, somewhere, did assemble things so that it's easy for dummies\nlike me to install \"a Linux machine\". What? This 386 DX/16 PC I\nborrowed from my lab could be something like one of these very very\nvery mysterious and expensive Sun machines that a few very bearded and\nvery smelly dudes are using at Onera to perform high performance\ncalculations? I have to do this. Not growing a beard, but install Linux.\n</p><p>\nI could even \"read mail\" on them. Doh, I could even read those\nmysterious \"newsgroups\", that look like our Fidonet \"conferences\", the\nonly difference being.\n</p><p>\nAll this is so interesting. So, at first, let's help my friend René to\nspread out this marvel to the world. René did setup his \"Renux\" box\nfor this and everybody can access it through this very modern UUCP\ntechnology, to download Slackware disk images, last versions of the\nLinux kernel (direct from ftp.ibp.fr, thanks to another pionneer, Rémy\nCard....ext2fs author). So, I did setup an incredibly weird system to\n\"download\" this stuff by FTPmail, de-uuencode it, process it on my\nwork machine and then re-upload it to my home BBS and make it\navailable in one of the first \"Linux\" sections of French\nBBS. Yay. Even of my BBS machine is not running this wonder.\n</p><p>\nStill, gradually, I was becoming bored of this BBS stuff. The sirens\nof open systems were constantly singing in my ears and the amount of\nwork to put in running a Fidonet node wasn't really motivating for me anymore.\n</p><p>\nFinally, after our daughter Magali was born, in March 1992, I decided to shut down my\nBBS....and just run as a Fidonet \"point\" (a personal system not opened\nto the public) and gradually switched my interest to these open systems.\n</p><p>\nI thus ended running an \"experimental\" Linux system at work on this refurbished\n386DX machine, already and playing between both worlds for about 18\nmonths.\n</p><p>\nAt some point, around mid-1993, it became obvious to me that I more\nwanted to participate to newsgroups-style communication, participate\nto the advent of this Linux thing and learn things about what was to\nbecome \"The Internet\" (understand \"the web\", aha).\n</p><p>\nMeanwhile, René did great work translating \"The Linux System\" by this\nguy, Matt Welsh, making The Thing accessible to dummies like me.\n</p><p>\nSo, after summer, I decided it was time to move on and shutdown this\nFidonet thing and build something like my \"Freenix\" friends were\nrunning, and be able to download news and mail by UUCP, with my fast\nHST modem, and process them with Real Men tools such as inn, sendmail, pine and trn.\n</p><p>\nAnd then, around October 1993, here I come ready to install a Linux\nmachine at home, and therefore zap a few years of BBS stuff on my 40MB\nhard disk. But, eh, I just read about this shiny new thing named\nDebian, that was just announced a few weeks ago. It seems to be meant\nfor dummies like me who need a little bit more than tarballs of binary\ncode and have no clue about libraries, ABI and such mysterious things\nthat apparenyl constantly lead to \"core dumps\" on my work experimental\nSlackware machine.\n</p><p>\nAlso, I don't really understand everything to what these dude says in\nhis \"Manifesto\" but that seems interesting and his (their? dunno)\nthing seem easy to use. Let's download the 0.93whatever version of\nthis thing and put this on a big set of floppies.\n</p><p>\nA few days after, voilà. I have my first Linux system at home and it\nis running that Debian thing. It will need several weeks of poking\naround documentations, playing weird things with INN and sendmail\nwithout understanding a s**t of both....and a lot of help from Freenix\nfriends....and I end up with a working machine that can call out FrMug\nfor UUCP downloads of mail and news and then feed local sendmail and\nINN servers with them and then allow the \"bubulle\" user to read them\nremotely...from his Windows machine.\n</p><p>\nYay, admitedly, I spent a few years\nstill using a Windows machine for mail and news! How to say that? At\nthat time, the GUI environments were a little bit rustic and, anyway,\nthere was no point-and-click programs for mail and news.\n</p><p>\nIn the meantime, the machine got upgraded to Debian 1.1 by\nreinstalling the system. \"kheops\" was born....and so was\nbubulle@kheops.frmug.fr.net.\n</p><p>\nWe're probably around early 1994 and I'm running my first Debian\nserver at home.\n</p><p>\nThe beard didn't grew up, I'm not eating pizzas all day long (but I\ndrink beer) and I'm even practicing physical activities (I was a\nvolleyball player at that time). Despite all these flaws, I'm turning\ninto a geek, slowly.\n</p><p>\nIn next episode, you'll learn how I ended up dropping the use of\nWindows, compiling some free software and contributing to my first\npackage. These will be \"the genealogy years\".</p>"

Look at the article for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security\"><abbr title=\"Transport Layer Security\"><abbr title=\"Transport Layer Security\"><span>TLS</span></abbr></abbr> on Wikipedia</a> for some\nbackground on this.</p>\n<p>One year ago, Adam Langley, from Google,\n<a href=\"http://www.imperialviolet.org/2010/06/25/overclocking-ssl.html\">stated <abbr title=\"Secure Sockets Layer\"><abbr title=\"Secure Sockets Layer\"><span>SSL</span></abbr></abbr> was not computationally expensive any more</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In January this year (2010), Gmail switched to using <span>HTTPS</span> for\neverything by default. Previously it had been introduced as an option,\nbut now all of our users use <span>HTTPS</span> to secure their email between their\nbrowsers and Google, all the time. In order to do this we had to\ndeploy no additional machines and no special hardware. On our\nproduction frontend machines, <abbr title=\"Secure Sockets Layer\"><span>SSL</span></abbr>/<abbr title=\"Transport Layer Security\"><span>TLS</span></abbr> accounts for less than 1% of the\n<span>CPU</span> load, less than <span>10KB</span> of memory per connection and less than 2% of\nnetwork overhead. Many people believe that <abbr title=\"Secure Sockets Layer\"><span>SSL</span></abbr> takes a lot of <span>CPU</span> time\nand we hope the above numbers (public for the first time) will help to\ndispel that.</p>\n<p>If you stop reading now you only need to remember one thing: <abbr title=\"Secure Sockets Layer\"><span>SSL</span></abbr>/<abbr title=\"Transport Layer Security\"><span>TLS</span></abbr>\nis not computationally expensive any more.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is a very informative post containing tips on how to enhance <abbr title=\"Secure Sockets Layer\"><span>SSL</span></abbr>\nperformance by reducing latency. However, unlike Gmail, you may still\nbe worried by <abbr title=\"Secure Sockets Layer\"><span>SSL</span></abbr> raw performances. Maybe each of your frontends is\nable to serve 2000 requests per second and <span>CPU</span> overhead for <abbr title=\"Secure Sockets Layer\"><span>SSL</span></abbr> is\ntherefore significative. Maybe you want to terminate <abbr title=\"Secure Sockets Layer\"><span>SSL</span></abbr> in your load\nbalancer (even if you know\n<a href=\"http://hezmatt.org/~mpalmer/blog/2011/06/28/ssl-session-caching-in-nginx.html\">this is not the best way to scale</a>).</p>\n<h1>Tuning <abbr title=\"Secure Sockets Layer\"><span>SSL</span></abbr></h1>\n<p>There are a lot of knobs you can use to get better performances from\n<abbr title=\"Secure Sockets Layer\"><span>SSL</span></abbr>: choosing the best <strong>implementation</strong>, using more <strong><span>CPU</span> cores</strong>,\nswitching to <strong>64bit</strong> system, choosing the right <strong>cipher suite</strong> and\nthe appropriate <strong>key size</strong> and enabling a <strong>session cache</strong>.</p>\n<p>We will consider three <abbr title=\"Secure Sockets Layer\"><span>SSL</span></abbr> terminators. They all use OpenSSL behind\nthe hood. <a href=\"http://www.stunnel.org/\"><strong>stunnel</strong></a> is the oldest one and uses a threaded\nmodel. <a href=\"https://github.com/bumptech/stud\"><strong>stud</strong></a> is a recent attempt to write a simple <abbr title=\"Secure Sockets Layer\"><span>SSL</span></abbr>\nterminator which is efficient and scalable. It uses the\none-process-per-core model. <a href=\"http://wiki.nginx.org/\"><strong>nginx</strong></a> is a web server and it\ncan be used as reverse proxy and therefore act as <abbr title=\"Secure Sockets Layer\"><span>SSL</span></abbr> terminator. It\nis known to be one of the most efficient web server, hence the choice\nhere. It also features built-in basic load balancing. Since <em>stud</em> and\n<em>stunnel</em> does not have this feature, we use them with\n<a href=\"http://haproxy.1wt.eu/\">HAProxy</a>, an high performance load-balancer that usually\ndefers the <abbr title=\"Secure Sockets Layer\"><span>SSL</span></abbr> part to <em>stunnel</em> (but <em>stud</em> can act as a drop-in\nreplacement here).</p>\n<p>Those implementations were already tested by\n<a href=\"http://matt.io/\">Matt Stancliff</a>. He first concluded\n<a href=\"http://matt.io/entry/uq\">nginx sucked at <abbr title=\"Secure Sockets Layer\"><abbr title=\"Secure Sockets Layer\"><span>SSL</span></abbr></abbr></a> then that\n<a href=\"http://matt.io/entry/ur\">nginx did not suck at <abbr title=\"Secure Sockets Layer\"><abbr title=\"Secure Sockets Layer\"><span>SSL</span></abbr></abbr></a> (in the first case, <em>nginx</em> was the\nonly one to select a <abbr title=\"Diffie Hellman Ephemeral\"><span>DHE</span></abbr> cipher suite). The details were very\nscarce. I hope to bring here more details.</p>\n<p>This brings the importance of the selected cipher suite. The client\nand the server must agree on the cipher suite to use for symmetric\nencryption. The server will select the strongest one it supports from\nthe list proposed by the client. If you enable some expensive cipher\nsuite on your server, it is likely to be selected.</p>\n<p>The last important knob is <abbr title=\"Secure Sockets Layer\"><span>SSL</span></abbr> session reuse. It matters for both\nperformance and latency. During the first handshake, the server will\nsend a <em>session <span>ID</span></em>. The client can use this session <span>ID</span> to request an\n<em>abbreviated handshake</em>. This handshake is shorter (latency\nimprovement by one round-trip) and allows to reuse the previously\nnegociated master secret (performance improvement by skipping the\ncostliest part of the handshake). See the\n<a href=\"http://www.imperialviolet.org/2010/06/25/overclocking-ssl.html\">article from Adam Langley</a> for additional information (with\nhelpful drawings).</p>\n<p>The following table shows what cipher suite is selected by some major\nweb sites. I have also indicated wheter they support session\nreuse. See this\n<a href=\"http://hezmatt.org/~mpalmer/blog/2011/06/28/ssl-session-caching-in-nginx.html\">post from Matt Palmer to know how to check this</a>.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Site</th>\n<th>Cipher</th>\n<th>Session reuse?</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>www.google.com</td>\n<td><span>RC4</span>-<span>SHA</span></td>\n<td>✓</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>www.facebook.com</td>\n<td><span>RC4</span>-<span>MD5</span></td>\n<td>✓</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>twitter.com</td>\n<td><span>AES256</span>-<span>SHA</span></td>\n<td>✕</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>windowsupdate.microsoft.com</td>\n<td><span>RC4</span>-<span>MD5</span></td>\n<td>✕</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>www.paypal.com</td>\n<td><span>AES256</span>-<span>SHA</span></td>\n<td>✕</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>www.cmcicpaiement.fr</td>\n<td><abbr title=\"Diffie Hellman Ephemeral\"><span>DHE</span></abbr>-<span>RSA</span>-<span>AES256</span>-<span>SHA</span></td>\n<td>✓</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><a href=\"http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5077\"><span>RFC</span> 5077</a> defines another mechanism for session resumption\nthat does not require any server-side state. I did not investigate\nmuch how this works but it does not rely on the session <span>ID</span>.</p>\n<h1>Benchmarks</h1>\n<p>All those benchmarks have been run on a <span>HP</span> <span>DL</span> 380 G7, with two\n<a href=\"http://ark.intel.com/products/47927\">Xeon L5630</a> (running at 2.13GHz for a total of 8 cores),\nwithout hyperthreading, using a 2.6.39 kernel (<code>HZ</code> is set to 250) and\ntwo <a href=\"http://download.intel.com/design/network/ProdBrf/320025.pdf\">Intel 82576 <span>NIC</span></a>. Linux conntrack subsystem has been\ndisabled and file limits have been raised over 100,000.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"http://www.spirent.com/Solutions-Directory/Avalanche.aspx\">Spirent Avalanche 2900</a> appliance is used to run the benchmarks.</p>\n<p>We are interested in raw <abbr title=\"Secure Sockets Layer\"><span>SSL</span></abbr> performances in term of handshakes per\nsecond. Because we want to observe the effects of session reuse, the\nscenario runs by most tests lets clients doing four successive\nrequests and reusing the <abbr title=\"Secure Sockets Layer\"><span>SSL</span></abbr> session for three of them. There is no\n<span>HTTP</span> keepalive. There is no compression. The size of the <span>HTTP</span> answer\nfrom the server is 1024 bytes. Those choices are done because our\nprimary target is the number of <abbr title=\"Secure Sockets Layer\"><span>SSL</span></abbr> handshakes per second.</p>\n<p>It should also be noted that HAProxy alone is able to handle 22,000\n<abbr title=\"Transactions per second\"><span>TPS</span></abbr> on one core. During the tests, it was never the bottleneck.</p>\n<h2>Implementation</h2>\n<p>We run a first bench to compare <em>nginx</em>, <em>stud</em> and <em>stunnel</em> on one\ncore. This bench runs on a 32bit system, with <span>AES128</span>-<span>SHA1</span> cipher suite\nand a 1024bit key size. Here is the result for <em>stud</em> (version 0.1,\nwith <a href=\"https://github.com/bumptech/stud/pull/10\">Émeric Brun’s patch for <abbr title=\"Secure Sockets Layer\"><abbr title=\"Secure Sockets Layer\"><span>SSL</span></abbr></abbr> session reuse</a>):</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://media.luffy.cx/images/benchs-ssl/stud-1cpu.png\" alt=\"stud, 1 CPU\"></p>\n<p>The most important plot is the top one. The blue line is the attempted\nnumber of transactions per second (<abbr title=\"Transactions per second\"><span>TPS</span></abbr>) while the green one is the\nsuccessful number of <abbr title=\"Transactions per second\"><span>TPS</span></abbr>. When the two lines start to diverge, this\nmeans we reach some kind of maximum: the number of unsuccessful <abbr title=\"Transactions per second\"><span>TPS</span></abbr>\nalso starts to raise (the red line).</p>\n<p>There are several noticeable points: the maximum <abbr title=\"Transactions per second\"><span>TPS</span></abbr> (788 <abbr title=\"Transactions per second\"><span>TPS</span></abbr>), the\nmaximum <abbr title=\"Transactions per second\"><span>TPS</span></abbr> with an average response time less than 100 ms (766 <abbr title=\"Transactions per second\"><span>TPS</span></abbr>),\nless than 500 ms (776 <abbr title=\"Transactions per second\"><span>TPS</span></abbr>) and the maximum <abbr title=\"Transactions per second\"><span>TPS</span></abbr> with less than 0.01% of\npacket loss (783 <abbr title=\"Transactions per second\"><span>TPS</span></abbr>).</p>\n<p>Let’s have a look at <em>nginx</em> (version 1.0.5):</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://media.luffy.cx/images/benchs-ssl/nginx-1cpu.png\" alt=\"nginx, 1 CPU\"></p>\n<p>It is able to get the same performance as <em>stud</em> (763 <abbr title=\"Transactions per second\"><span>TPS</span></abbr>). However,\nover 512 <abbr title=\"Transactions per second\"><span>TPS</span></abbr>, you get more than 100 ms of response time. Over 556 <abbr title=\"Transactions per second\"><span>TPS</span></abbr>,\nyou even get more than 500 ms! I get this behaviour in every bench\nwith <em>nginx</em> (with or without <code>proxy_buffering</code>, with or without\n<code>tcp_nopush</code>, with or without <code>tcp_nodelay</code>) and I am unable to\nexplain it. Maybe there is\n<a href=\"https://gist.github.com/1145093\">something wrong in the configuration</a>. After hitting this\nlimit, <em>nginx</em> starts to process connections by bursts. Therefore, the\nnumber of successful <abbr title=\"Transactions per second\"><span>TPS</span></abbr> is plotted using a dotted line while the\nmoving average over 20 seconds is plotted with a solid line.</p>\n<p>On the next plot, you can see the compared performance of the three\nimplementations. On this kind of plot, the number of <abbr title=\"Transactions per second\"><span>TPS</span></abbr> that we keep\nis the maximum number of <abbr title=\"Transactions per second\"><span>TPS</span></abbr> where loss is less than 0.1% and average\nresponse time is less than 100 ms. <em>stud</em> achieves a performance of\n766 <abbr title=\"Transactions per second\"><span>TPS</span></abbr> while <em>nginx</em> and <em>stunnel</em> are just above 500 <abbr title=\"Transactions per second\"><span>TPS</span></abbr>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://media.luffy.cx/images/benchs-ssl/stunnel-stud-nginx-1cpu.png\" alt=\"stunnel vs stud vs nginx, 1 CPU\"></p>\n<h2>Number of cores</h2>\n<p>With multiple cores, we can affect several of them to do <abbr title=\"Secure Sockets Layer\"><span>SSL</span></abbr> hard\nwork. To get better performance, we pin each processes to a dedicated\n<span>CPU</span>. Here is the repartition used during the tests:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>1 core</th>\n<th>2 cores</th>\n<th>4 cores</th>\n<th>6 cores</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><span>CPU</span> 1, Core 1</td>\n<td>network</td>\n<td>network</td>\n<td>network</td>\n<td>network + haproxy</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span>CPU</span> 1, Core 2</td>\n<td>haproxy</td>\n<td>haproxy</td>\n<td>haproxy</td>\n<td><abbr title=\"Secure Sockets Layer\"><span>SSL</span></abbr></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span>CPU</span> 1, Core 3</td>\n<td><abbr title=\"Secure Sockets Layer\"><span>SSL</span></abbr></td>\n<td><abbr title=\"Secure Sockets Layer\"><span>SSL</span></abbr></td>\n<td><abbr title=\"Secure Sockets Layer\"><span>SSL</span></abbr></td>\n<td><abbr title=\"Secure Sockets Layer\"><span>SSL</span></abbr></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span>CPU</span> 1, Core 4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td><abbr title=\"Secure Sockets Layer\"><span>SSL</span></abbr></td>\n<td><abbr title=\"Secure Sockets Layer\"><span>SSL</span></abbr></td>\n<td><abbr title=\"Secure Sockets Layer\"><span>SSL</span></abbr></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span>CPU</span> 2, Core 5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>network</td>\n<td><abbr title=\"Secure Sockets Layer\"><span>SSL</span></abbr></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span>CPU</span> 2, Core 6</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td><abbr title=\"Secure Sockets Layer\"><span>SSL</span></abbr></td>\n<td><abbr title=\"Secure Sockets Layer\"><span>SSL</span></abbr></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span>CPU</span> 2, Core 7</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td><abbr title=\"Secure Sockets Layer\"><span>SSL</span></abbr></td>\n<td><abbr title=\"Secure Sockets Layer\"><span>SSL</span></abbr></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span>CPU</span> 2, Core 8</td>\n<td>system</td>\n<td>system</td>\n<td>system</td>\n<td>system + haproxy</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Remember, we have two <span>CPU</span>, 4 cores on each <span>CPU</span>. Cores on the same <span>CPU</span>\nshare the same L2 cache (on this model). Therefore, the arrangement\ninside a <span>CPU</span> is not really important. When possible, we try to keep\nthings together on the same <span>CPU</span>. The <abbr title=\"Secure Sockets Layer\"><span>SSL</span></abbr> processes always get\nexclusive use of a core since they will always be the most busy. The\nrepartition is done with <a href=\"http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man7/cpuset.7.html\">cpuset(7)</a> for userland processes\nand by setting <code>smp_affinity</code> for network card interrupts.</p>\n<p>We keep one core for the system. It is quite important to be able to\nconnect and monitor the system correctly even when it is loaded. With\nso many cores, we can afford to reserve one core for this usage.</p>\n<p>Beware! There is a trap when pining processes or <span>IRQ</span> to a core. You\nneed to check <code>/proc/cpuinfo</code> to discover the mapping between kernel\nprocessors and physical cores. Sometimes, second kernel processor can\nbe the first core of the second physical processor (instead of the\nsecond core of the first physical processor).</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://media.luffy.cx/images/benchs-ssl/scalability-6cores.png\" alt=\"stunnel vs stud vs nginx, 6 CPU\"></p>\n<p>As you can see in the plot above, only <em>stud</em> is able to scale\nproperly. <em>stunnel</em> is not able to take advantage of the cores and its\nperformances are worse than with a single core. I think this may be\ndue to its threaded model and the fact that the userland for this\n32bit system is a bit old. <em>nginx</em> is able to achieve the same <abbr title=\"Transactions per second\"><span>TPS</span></abbr>\nthan <em>stud</em> but is disqualified because of the increased latency. We\nwon’t use <em>stunnel</em> in the remaining tests.</p>\n<h2>32bit vs 64bit</h2>\n<p>The easiest way to achieve a performance boost is to switch to a 64bit\nsystem. <abbr title=\"Transactions per second\"><span>TPS</span></abbr> are doubled. On our 64bit system, thanks to the use of a\nversion of OpenSSL with the appropriate support, <abbr title=\"Advanced Encryption Standard\"><span>AES</span></abbr>-<span>NI</span>, a <span>CPU</span>\nextension to improve the speed of <abbr title=\"Advanced Encryption Standard\"><span>AES</span></abbr> encryption/decryption, is\nenabled. Remaining tests are done with a 64bit system.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://media.luffy.cx/images/benchs-ssl/64bit.png\" alt=\"stud vs nginx, 64bit\"></p>\n<h2>Ciphers and key sizes</h2>\n<p>In our tests, the influence of ciphers is minimal. There is almost no\ndifference between <span>AES256</span> and <span>AES128</span>. Using <span>RC4</span> adds some latency. The\nuse of <abbr title=\"Advanced Encryption Standard\"><span>AES</span></abbr>-<span>NI</span> may have helped to avoid this latency for <abbr title=\"Advanced Encryption Standard\"><span>AES</span></abbr>.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, using a 2048bit key size has a huge performance\nhit. <abbr title=\"Transactions per second\"><span>TPS</span></abbr> are divided by 5.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://media.luffy.cx/images/benchs-ssl/ciphers.png\" alt=\"stud: cipher suites and key sizes\"></p>\n<h2>Session cache</h2>\n<p>The last thing to check is the influence of <abbr title=\"Secure Sockets Layer\"><span>SSL</span></abbr> session reuse. Since\nwe are on a local network, we see only one of the positive effects of\nsession reuse: better <abbr title=\"Transactions per second\"><span>TPS</span></abbr> because of reduced <span>CPU</span> usages. If there was\na latency penalty, we should also have seen better\n<abbr title=\"Transactions per second\"><span>TPS</span></abbr> thanks to the removed round-trip.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://media.luffy.cx/images/benchs-ssl/session-reuse.png\" alt=\"stud: session reuse\"></p>\n<p>This plot also explains why <em>stud</em> performances fall after the\nmaximum: because of the failed transactions, the session cache is not\nas efficient. This phenomenon does not exist when session reuse is not enabled.</p>\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>Here is a summary of the maximum <abbr title=\"Transactions per second\"><span>TPS</span></abbr> reached during the benchmark\n(with an average response time below 100ms). Our control use case is\nthe following: 64bit, 6 cores, <span>AES128</span>, <span>SHA1</span>, 1024bit key, 4 requests\ninto the same <abbr title=\"Secure Sockets Layer\"><span>SSL</span></abbr> session.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Context</th>\n<th>nginx 1.0.5</th>\n<th>stunnel 4.41</th>\n<th>stud 0.1 (<a href=\"https://github.com/bumptech/stud/pull/10\">patched</a>)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1 core, 32bit</td>\n<td>512 <abbr title=\"Transactions per second\"><span>TPS</span></abbr></td>\n<td>503 <abbr title=\"Transactions per second\"><span>TPS</span></abbr></td>\n<td>766 <abbr title=\"Transactions per second\"><span>TPS</span></abbr></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2 cores, 32bit</td>\n<td>599 <abbr title=\"Transactions per second\"><span>TPS</span></abbr></td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>32bit</td>\n<td>804 <abbr title=\"Transactions per second\"><span>TPS</span></abbr></td>\n<td>501 <abbr title=\"Transactions per second\"><span>TPS</span></abbr></td>\n<td>4251 <abbr title=\"Transactions per second\"><span>TPS</span></abbr></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>-</td>\n<td><strong>1799 <abbr title=\"Transactions per second\"><abbr title=\"Transactions per second\"><span>TPS</span></abbr></abbr></strong></td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td><strong>9000 <abbr title=\"Transactions per second\"><abbr title=\"Transactions per second\"><span>TPS</span></abbr></abbr></strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span>AES256</span></td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>8880 <abbr title=\"Transactions per second\"><span>TPS</span></abbr></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span>RC4</span>-<span>MD5</span></td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>7370 <abbr title=\"Transactions per second\"><span>TPS</span></abbr></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2048bit</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>1643 <abbr title=\"Transactions per second\"><span>TPS</span></abbr></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>no session reuse</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>5844 <abbr title=\"Transactions per second\"><span>TPS</span></abbr></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>80 requests per <abbr title=\"Secure Sockets Layer\"><span>SSL</span></abbr> session</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>10797 <abbr title=\"Transactions per second\"><span>TPS</span></abbr></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Therefore, <em>stud</em> in our control scenario is able to sustain 1500 <abbr title=\"Transactions per second\"><span>TPS</span></abbr>\nper core. It seems to be the best current option for a <abbr title=\"Secure Sockets Layer\"><span>SSL</span></abbr>\ntermination.

      "content" : "<p>For the purposes of this post, I will be talking about JavaScript objects using syntax defined in ECMAScript 5.1. The basic semantics existed in Edition 3, but they were not well exposed.</p>\n<h1>A Whole New Object</h1>\n<p>In JavaScript, objects are pairs of keys and values (in Ruby, this structure is called a Hash; in Python, it’s called a dictionary). For example, if I wanted to describe my name, I could have an object with two keys: `firstName` would point to “Yehuda” and `lastName` would point to “Katz”. Keys in a JavaScript object are Strings.</p>\n<p>To create the simplest new object in JavaScript, you can use <code>Object.create</code>:</p>\n\n<div><table><tr><td><pre style=\"font-family:monospace\"><span style=\"color:#000066;font-weight:bold\">var</span> person <span style=\"color:#339933\">=</span> <span>Object</span>.<span style=\"color:#660066\">create</span><span style=\"color:#009900\">(</span><span style=\"color:#003366;font-weight:bold\">null</span><span style=\"color:#009900\">)</span><span style=\"color:#339933\">;</span> <span style=\"color:#006600;font-style:italic\">// this creates an empty objects</span></pre></td></tr></table></div>\n\n<p>Why didn’t we just use <code>var person = {};</code>? Stick with me! To look up a value in the object by key, use bracket notation. If there is no value for the key in question, JavaScript will return `undefined`.</p>\n\n<div><table><tr><td><pre style=\"font-family:monospace\">person<span style=\"color:#009900\">[</span><span style=\"color:#3366cc\">'name'</span><span style=\"color:#009900\">]</span> <span style=\"color:#006600;font-style:italic\">// undefined</span></pre></td></tr></table></div>\n\n<p>If the String is a valid identifier[1], you can use the dot form:</p>\n\n<div><table><tr><td><pre style=\"font-family:monospace\">person.<span style=\"color:#660066\">name</span> <span style=\"color:#006600;font-style:italic\">// undefined</span></pre></td></tr></table></div>\n\n<p><small><em>[1] in general, an <a href=\"http://es5.github.com/#x7.6\">identifier</a> starts with a unicode letter, $, _, followed by any of the starting characters or numbers. A valid identifier must also not be a <a href=\"http://es5.github.com/#x7.6.1\">reserved word</a>. There are other allowed characters, such as unicode combining marks, unicode connecting punctuation, and unicode escape sequences. Check out the spec for the full details</em></small></p>\n<h1>Adding values</h1>\n<p>So now you have an empty object. Not that useful, eh? Before we can add some properties, we need to understand what a property (what the spec calls a “named data property”) looks like in JavaScript.</p>\n<p>Obviously, a property has a name and a value. In addition, a property can be <strong>enumerable</strong>, <strong>configurable</strong> and <strong>writable</strong>. If a value is enumerable, it will show up when enumerating over an object using a <code>for(prop in obj)</code> loop. If a property is writable, you can replace it. If a property is configurable, you can delete it or change its other attributes.</p>\n<p>In general, when we create a new property, we will want it to be enumerable, configurable, and writable. In fact, prior to ECMAScript 5, that was the only kind of property a user could create directly.</p>\n<p>We can add a property to an object using <code>Object.defineProperty</code>. Let’s add a first name and last name to our empty object:</p>\n\n<div><table><tr><td><pre style=\"font-family:monospace\"><span style=\"color:#000066;font-weight:bold\">var</span> person <span style=\"color:#339933\">=</span> <span>Object</span>.<span style=\"color:#660066\">create</span><span style=\"color:#009900\">(</span><span style=\"color:#003366;font-weight:bold\">null</span><span style=\"color:#009900\">)</span><span style=\"color:#339933\">;</span>\n<span>Object</span>.<span style=\"color:#660066\">defineProperty</span><span style=\"color:#009900\">(</span>person<span style=\"color:#339933\">,</span> <span style=\"color:#3366cc\">'firstName'</span><span style=\"color:#339933\">,</span> <span style=\"color:#009900\">{</span>\n  value<span style=\"color:#339933\">:</span> <span style=\"color:#3366cc\">&quot;Yehuda&quot;</span><span style=\"color:#339933\">,</span>\n  writable<span style=\"color:#339933\">:</span> <span style=\"color:#003366;font-weight:bold\">true</span><span style=\"color:#339933\">,</span>\n  enumerable<span style=\"color:#339933\">:</span> <span style=\"color:#003366;font-weight:bold\">true</span><span style=\"color:#339933\">,</span>\n  configurable<span style=\"color:#339933\">:</span> <span style=\"color:#003366;font-weight:bold\">true</span>\n<span style=\"color:#009900\">}</span><span style=\"color:#009900\">)</span><span style=\"color:#339933\">;</span>\n \n<span>Object</span>.<span style=\"color:#660066\">defineProperty</span><span style=\"color:#009900\">(</span>person<span style=\"color:#339933\">,</span> <span style=\"color:#3366cc\">'lastName'</span><span style=\"color:#339933\">,</span> <span style=\"color:#009900\">{</span>\n  value<span style=\"color:#339933\">:</span> <span style=\"color:#3366cc\">&quot;Katz&quot;</span><span style=\"color:#339933\">,</span>\n  writable<span style=\"color:#339933\">:</span> <span style=\"color:#003366;font-weight:bold\">true</span><span style=\"color:#339933\">,</span>\n  enumerable<span style=\"color:#339933\">:</span> <span style=\"color:#003366;font-weight:bold\">true</span><span style=\"color:#339933\">,</span>\n  configurable<span style=\"color:#339933\">:</span> <span style=\"color:#003366;font-weight:bold\">true</span>\n<span style=\"color:#009900\">}</span><span style=\"color:#009900\">)</span><span style=\"color:#339933\">;</span></pre></td></tr></table></div>\n\n<p>Obviously, this is extremely verbose.

Before we can get to a prettier solution, we will need to add another weapon to our JavaScript object arsenal.</p>\n<h1>Prototypes</h1>\n<p>So far, we’ve talked about objects as simple pairs of keys and values. In fact, JavaScript objects also have one additional attribute: a pointer to <em>another</em> object. We call this pointer the object’s <em>prototype</em>. If you try to look up a key on an object and it is not found, JavaScript will look for it in the prototype. It will follow the “prototype chain” until it sees a <code>null</code> value. In that case, it returns <code>undefined</code>.</p>\n<p>You’ll recall that we created a new object by invoking <code>Object.create(null)</code>. The parameter tells JavaScript what it should set as the Object’s <em>prototype</em>. You can look up an object’s prototype by using <code>Object.getPrototypeOf</code>:</p>\n\n<div><table><tr><td><pre style=\"font-family:monospace\"><span

Of course, objects can happily override them by defining the properties directly.

The goal of this method is to create a new object with a set of properties, but with a particular prototype. First, we will use <code>Object.create()</code> to create a new empty object, and assign the prototype we specify. Next, we will enumerate all of the properties in the object that we supplied, and copy them over to the new object.</p>\n<p>Remember that when you create an object literal, like the ones we are passing in to <code>fromPrototype</code>, it will always have <code>Object.prototype</code> as its prototype. By default, the properties that JavaScript includes on <code>Object.prototype</code> are <em>not enumerable</em>, so we don’t have to worry about <code>valueOf</code> showing up in our loop. However, since <code>Object.prototype</code> is an object like any other object, anyone can define a new property on it, which may (and probably would) be marked enumerable.</p>\n<p>As a result, while we are looping through the properties on the object we passed in, we want to restrict our copying to properties that were defined on the object itself, and not found on the prototype. JavaScript includes a method called <code>hasOwnProperty</code> on <code>Object.prototype</code> to check whether a property was defined on the object itself. Since object literals will always have <code>Object.prototype</code> as their prototype, you can use it in this manner.</p>\n<p>The object we created in the example above looks like this:</p>\n<p><img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"http://yehudakatz.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/prototype-chain-2.png\" alt=\"prototype-chain-2.png\" title=\"prototype-chain-2.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"464\" height=\"588\"></p>\n<h1>Native Object Orientation</h1>\n<p>At this point, it should be obvious that prototypes can be used to inherit functionality, much like traditional object oriented languages. To facilitate using it in this manner, JavaScript provides a <code>new</code> operator.</p>\n<p>In order to facilitate object oriented programming, JavaScript allows you to use a Function object as a combination of a prototype to use for the new object and a constructor function to invoke:</p>\n\n<div><table><tr><td><pre style=\"font-family:monospace\"><span style=\"color:#000066;font-weight:bold\">var</span> Person <span style=\"color:#339933\">=</span> <span style=\"color:#000066;font-weight:bold\">function</span><span style=\"color:#009900\">(</span>firstName<span style=\"color:#339933\">,</span> lastName<span style=\"color:#009900\">)</span> <span style=\"color:#009900\">{</span>\n  <span style=\"color:#000066;font-weight:bold\">this</span>.<span style=\"color:#660066\">firstName</span> <span style=\"color:#339933\">=</span> firstName<span style=\"color:#339933\">;</span>\n  <span style=\"color:#000066;font-weight:bold\">this</span>.<span style=\"color:#660066\">lastName</span> <span style=\"color:#339933\">=</span> lastName<span style=\"color:#339933\">;</span>\n<span style=\"color:#009900\">}</span>\n \nPerson.<span style=\"color:#000066;font-weight:bold\">prototype</span> <span style=\"color:#339933\">=</span> <span style=\"color:#009900\">{</span>\n  toString<span style=\"color:#339933\">:</span> <span style=\"color:#000066;font-weight:bold\">function</span><span style=\"color:#009900\">(</span><span style=\"color:#009900\">)</span> <span style=\"color:#009900\">{</span> <span style=\"color:#000066;font-weight:bold\">return</span> <span style=\"color:#000066;font-weight:bold\">this</span>.<span style=\"color:#660066\">firstName</span> <span style=\"color:#339933\">+</span> <span style=\"color:#3366cc\">' '</span> <span style=\"color:#339933\">+</span> <span style=\"color:#000066;font-weight:bold\">this</span>.<span style=\"color:#660066\">lastName</span><span style=\"color:#339933\">;</span> <span style=\"color:#009900\">}</span>\n<span style=\"color:#009900\">}</span></pre></td></tr></table></div>\n\n<p>Here, we have a single Function object that is both a constructor function and an object to use as the prototype of new objects.

In particular, a lot of people have complained that the semantics of `this` in function invocations is confusing.</p>\n<p>In my opinion, a lot of this confusion is cleared up by understanding the core function invocation primitive, and then looking at all other ways of invoking a function as sugar on top of that primitive. In fact, this is exactly how the ECMAScript spec thinks about it. In some areas, this post is a simplification of the spec, but the basic idea is the same.</p>\n<h1>The Core Primitive</h1>\n<p>First, let’s look at the core function invocation primitive, a Function’s <code>call</code> method[1]. The call method is relatively straight forward.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Make an argument list (<code>argList</code>) out of parameters 1 through the end</li>\n<li>The first parameter is <code>thisValue</code></li>\n<li>Invoke the function with <code>this</code> set to <code>thisValue</code> and the <code>argList</code> as its argument list</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For example:</p>\n\n<div><div><pre style=\"font-family:monospace\"><span style=\"color:#003366;font-weight:bold\">function</span> hello<span style=\"color:#009900\">(</span>thing<span style=\"color:#009900\">)</span> <span style=\"color:#009900\">{</span>\n  console.<span style=\"color:#660066\">log</span><span style=\"color:#009900\">(</span><span style=\"color:#000066;font-weight:bold\">this</span> <span style=\"color:#339933\">+</span> <span style=\"color:#3366cc\">&quot; says hello &quot;</span> <span style=\"color:#339933\">+</span> thing<span style=\"color:#009900\">)</span><span style=\"color:#339933\">;</span>\n<span style=\"color:#009900\">}</span>\n \nhello.<span style=\"color:#660066\">call</span><span style=\"color:#009900\">(</span><span style=\"color:#3366cc\">&quot;Yehuda&quot;</span><span style=\"color:#339933\">,</span> <span style=\"color:#3366cc\">&quot;world&quot;</span><span style=\"color:#009900\">)</span> <span style=\"color:#006600;font-style:italic\">//=&gt; Yehuda says hello world</span></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>As you can see, we invoked the <code>hello</code> method with <code>this</code> set to <code>\"Yehuda\"</code> and a single argument <code>\"world\"</code>. This is the core primitive of JavaScript function invocation. You can think of all other function calls as desugaring to this primitive. (to “desugar” is to take a convenient syntax and describe it in terms of a more basic core primitive).</p>\n<p><small><em>[1] In <a href=\"http://es5.github.com/#x15.3.4.4\">the ES5 spec</a>, the <code>call</code> method is described in terms of another, more low level primitive, but it’s a very thin wrapper on top of that primitive, so I’m simplifying a bit here. See the end of this post for more information.</em></small></p>\n<h1>Simple Function Invocation</h1>\n<p>Obviously, invoking functions with <code>call</code> all the time would be pretty annoying. JavaScript allows us to invoke functions directly using the parens syntax (<code>hello(\"world\")</code>. When we do that, the invocation desugars:</p>\n\n<div><div><pre style=\"font-family:monospace\"><span style=\"color:#003366;font-weight:bold\">function</span> hello<span style=\"color:#009900\">(</span>thing<span style=\"color:#009900\">)</span> <span style=\"color:#009900\">{</span>\n  console.<span style=\"color:#660066\">log</span><span style=\"color:#009900\">(</span><span style=\"color:#3366cc\">&quot;Hello &quot;</span> <span style=\"color:#339933\">+</span> thing<span style=\"color:#009900\">)</span><span style=\"color:#339933\">;</span>\n<span style=\"color:#009900\">}</span>\n \n<span style=\"color:#006600;font-style:italic\">// this:</span>\nhello<span style=\"color:#009900\">(</span><span style=\"color:#3366cc\">&quot;world&quot;</span><span style=\"color:#009900\">)</span>\n \n<span style=\"color:#006600;font-style:italic\">// desugars to:</span>\nhello.<span style=\"color:#660066\">call</span><span style=\"color:#009900\">(</span>window<span style=\"color:#339933\">,</span> <span style=\"color:#3366cc\">&quot;world&quot;</span><span style=\"color:#009900\">)</span><span style=\"color:#339933\">;</span></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>This behavior has changed in ECMAScript 5 <strong>only when using strict mode</strong>[2]:</p>\n\n<div><div><pre style=\"font-family:monospace\"><span style=\"color:#006600;font-style:italic\">// this:</span>\nhello<span style=\"color:#009900\">(</span><span style=\"color:#3366cc\">&quot;world&quot;</span><span style=\"color:#009900\">)</span>\n \n<span style=\"color:#006600;font-style:italic\">// desugars to:</span>\nhello.<span style=\"color:#660066\">call</span><span style=\"color:#009900\">(</span>undefined<span style=\"color:#339933\">,</span> <span style=\"color:#3366cc\">&quot;world&quot;</span><span style=\"color:#009900\">)</span><span style=\"color:#339933\">;</span></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>The short version is: <strong>a function invocation like <code>fn(...args)</code> is the same as <code>fn.call(window [ES5-strict: undefined], ...args)</code></strong>.</p>\n<p>Note that this is also true about functions declared inline: <code>(function() {})()</code> is the same as <code>(function() {}).call(window [ES5-strict: undefined)</code>.</p>\n<p><small><em>[2] Actually, I lied a bit. The ECMAScript 5 spec says that <code>undefined</code> is (almost) always passed, but that the function being called should change its <code>thisValue</code> to the global object when not in strict mode. This allows strict mode callers to avoid breaking existing non-strict-mode libraries.</em></small></p>\n<h1>Member Functions</h1>\n<p>The next very common way to invoke a method is as a member of an object (<code>person.hello()</code>). In this case, the invocation desugars:</p>\n\n<div><div><pre style=\"font-family:monospace\"><span style=\"color:#003366;font-weight:bold\">var</span> person <span style=\"color:#339933\">=</span> <span style=\"color:#009900\">{</span>\n  <span style=\"color:#000066\">name</span><span style=\"color:#339933\">:</span> <span style=\"color:#3366cc\">&quot;Brendan Eich&quot;</span><span style=\"color:#339933\">,</span>\n  hello<span style=\"color:#339933\">:</span> <span style=\"color:#003366;font-weight:bold\">function</span><span style=\"color:#009900\">(</span>thing<span style=\"color:#009900\">)</span> <span style=\"color:#009900\">{</span>\n    console.<span style=\"color:#660066\">log</span><span style=\"color:#009900\">(</span><span style=\"color:#000066;font-weight:bold\">this</span> <span style=\"color:#339933\">+</span> <span style=\"color:#3366cc\">&quot; says hello &quot;</span> <span style=\"color:#339933\">+</span> thing<span style=\"color:#009900\">)</span><span style=\"color:#339933\">;</span>\n  <span style=\"color:#009900\">}</span>\n<span style=\"color:#009900\">}</span>\n \n<span style=\"color:#006600;font-style:italic\">// this:</span>\nperson.<span style=\"color:#660066\">hello</span><span style=\"color:#009900\">(</span><span style=\"color:#3366cc\">&quot;world&quot;</span><span style=\"color:#009900\">)</span>\n \n<span style=\"color:#006600;font-style:italic\">// desugars to this:</span>\nperson.<span style=\"color:#660066\">hello</span>.<span style=\"color:#660066\">call</span><span style=\"color:#009900\">(</span>person<span style=\"color:#339933\">,</span> <span style=\"color:#3366cc\">&quot;world&quot;</span><span style=\"color:#009900\">)</span><span style=\"color:#339933\">;</span></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Note that it doesn't matter how the <code>hello</code> method becomes attached to the object in this form. Remember that we previously defined <code>hello</code> as a standalone function. Let's see what happens if we attach is to the object dynamically:</p>\n\n<div><div><pre style=\"font-family:monospace\"><span style=\"color:#003366;font-weight:bold\">function</span> hello<span style=\"color:#009900\">(</span>thing<span style=\"color:#009900\">)</span> <span style=\"color:#009900\">{</span>\n  console.<span style=\"color:#660066\">log</span><span style=\"color:#009900\">(</span><span style=\"color:#000066;font-weight:bold\">this</span> <span style=\"color:#339933\">+</span> <span style=\"color:#3366cc\">&quot; says hello &quot;</span> <span style=\"color:#339933\">+</span> thing<span style=\"color:#009900\">)</span><span style=\"color:#339933\">;</span>\n<span style=\"color:#009900\">}</span>\n \nperson <span style=\"color:#339933\">=</span> <span style=\"color:#009900\">{</span> <span style=\"color:#000066\">name</span><span style=\"color:#339933\">:</span> <span style=\"color:#3366cc\">&quot;Brendan Eich&quot;</span> <span style=\"color:#009900\">}</span>\nperson.<span style=\"color:#660066\">hello</span> <span style=\"color:#339933\">=</span> hello<span style=\"color:#339933\">;</span>\n \nperson.<span style=\"color:#660066\">hello</span><span style=\"color:#009900\">(</span><span style=\"color:#3366cc\">&quot;world&quot;</span><span style=\"color:#009900\">)</span> <span style=\"color:#006600;font-style:italic\">// still desugars to person.hello.call(person, &quot;world&quot;)</span>\n \nhello<span style=\"color:#009900\">(</span><span style=\"color:#3366cc\">&quot;world&quot;</span><span style=\"color:#009900\">)</span> <span style=\"color:#006600;font-style:italic\">// &quot;[object DOMWindow]world&quot;</span></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Notice that the function doesn't have a persistent notion of its 'this'. It is always set at call time based upon the way it was invoked by its caller.</p>\n<h1>Using <code>Function.prototype.bind</code></h1>\n<p>Because it can sometimes be convenient to have a reference to a function with a persistent <code>this</code> value, people have historically used a simple closure trick to convert a function into one with an unchanging <code>this</code>:</p>\n\n<div><div><pre style=\"font-family:monospace\"><span style=\"color:#003366;font-weight:bold\">var</span> person <span style=\"color:#339933\">=</span> <span style=\"color:#009900\">{</span>\n  <span style=\"color:#000066\">name</span><span style=\"color:#339933\">:</span> <span style=\"color:#3366cc\">&quot;Brendan Eich&quot;</span><span style=\"color:#339933\">,</span>\n  hello<span style=\"color:#339933\">:</span> <span style=\"color:#003366;font-weight:bold\">function</span><span style=\"color:#009900\">(</span>thing<span style=\"color:#009900\">)</span> <span style=\"color:#009900\">{</span>\n    console.<span style=\"color:#660066\">log</span><span style=\"color:#009900\">(</span><span style=\"color:#000066;font-weight:bold\">this</span>.<span style=\"color:#000066\">name</span> <span style=\"color:#339933\">+</span> <span style=\"color:#3366cc\">&quot; says hello &quot;</span> <span style=\"color:#339933\">+</span> thing<span style=\"color:#009900\">)</span><span style=\"color:#339933\">;</span>\n  <span style=\"color:#009900\">}</span>\n<span style=\"color:#009900\">}</span>\n \n<span style=\"color:#003366;font-weight:bold\">var</span> boundHello <span style=\"color:#339933\">=</span> <span style=\"color:#003366;font-weight:bold\">function</span><span style=\"color:#009900\">(</span>thing<span style=\"color:#009900\">)</span> <span style=\"color:#009900\">{</span> <span style=\"color:#000066;font-weight:bold\">return</span> person.<span style=\"color:#660066\">hello</span>.<span style=\"color:#660066\">call</span><span style=\"color:#009900\">(</span>person<span style=\"color:#339933\">,</span> thing<span style=\"color:#009900\">)</span><span style=\"color:#339933\">;</span> <span style=\"color:#009900\">}</span>\n \nboundHello<span style=\"color:#009900\">(</span><span style=\"color:#3366cc\">&quot;world&quot;</span><span style=\"color:#009900\">)</span><span style=\"color:#339933\">;</span></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Even though our <code>boundHello</code> call still desugars to <code>boundHello.call(window, \"world\")</code>, we turn right around and use our primitive <code>call</code> method to change the <code>this</code> value back to what we want it to be.</p>\n<p>We can make this trick general-purpose with a few tweaks:</p>\n\n<div><div><pre style=\"font-family:monospace\"><span style=\"color:#003366;font-weight:bold\">var</span> bind <span style=\"color:#339933\">=</span> <span style=\"color:#003366;font-weight:bold\">function</span><span style=\"color:#009900\">(</span>func<span style=\"color:#339933\">,</span> thisValue<span style=\"color:#009900\">)</span> <span style=\"color:#009900\">{</span>\n  <span style=\"color:#000066;font-weight:bold\">return</span> <span style=\"color:#003366;font-weight:bold\">function</span><span style=\"color:#009900\">(</span><span style=\"color:#009900\">)</span> <span style=\"color:#009900\">{</span>\n    <span style=\"color:#000066;font-weight:bold\">return</span> func.<span style=\"color:#660066\">apply</span><span style=\"color:#009900\">(</span>thisValue<span style=\"color:#339933\">,</span> arguments<span style=\"color:#009900\">)</span><span style=\"color:#339933\">;</span>\n  <span style=\"color:#009900\">}</span>\n<span style=\"color:#009900\">}</span>\n \n<span style=\"color:#003366;font-weight:bold\">var</span> boundHello <span style=\"color:#339933\">=</span> bind<span style=\"color:#009900\">(</span>person.<span style=\"color:#660066\">hello</span><span style=\"color:#339933\">,</span> person<span style=\"color:#009900\">)</span><span style=\"color:#339933\">;</span>\nboundHello<span style=\"color:#009900\">(</span><span style=\"color:#3366cc\">&quot;world&quot;</span><span style=\"color:#009900\">)</span> <span style=\"color:#006600;font-style:italic\">// &quot;Brendan Eich says hello world&quot;</span></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>In order to understand this, you just need two more pieces of information. First, <code>arguments</code> is an Array-like object that represents all of the arguments passed into a function. Second, the <code>apply</code> method works exactly like the <code>call</code> primitive, except that it takes an Array-like object instead of listing the arguments out one at a time.</p>\n<p>Our <code>bind</code> method simply returns a new function. When it is invoked, our new function simply invokes the original function that was passed in, setting the original value as <code>this</code>. It also passes through the arguments.</p>\n<p>Because this was a somewhat common idiom, ES5 introduced a new method <code>bind</code> on all <code>Function</code> objects that implements this behavior:</p>\n\n<div><div><pre style=\"font-family:monospace\"><span style=\"color:#003366;font-weight:bold\">var</span> boundHello <span style=\"color:#339933\">=</span> person.<span style=\"color:#660066\">hello</span>.<span style=\"color:#660066\">bind</span><span style=\"color:#009900\">(</span>person<span style=\"color:#009900\">)</span><span style=\"color:#339933\">;</span>\nboundHello<span style=\"color:#009900\">(</span><span style=\"color:#3366cc\">&quot;world&quot;</span><span style=\"color:#009900\">)</span> <span style=\"color:#006600;font-style:italic\">// &quot;Brendan Eich says hello world&quot;</span></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>This is most useful when you need a raw function to pass as a callback:</p>\n\n<div><div><pre style=\"font-family:monospace\"><span style=\"color:#003366;font-weight:bold\">var</span> person <span style=\"color:#339933\">=</span> <span style=\"color:#009900\">{</span>\n  <span style=\"color:#000066\">name</span><span style=\"color:#339933\">:</span> <span style=\"color:#3366cc\">&quot;Alex Russell&quot;</span><span style=\"color:#339933\">,</span>\n  hello<span style=\"color:#339933\">:</span> <span style=\"color:#003366;font-weight:bold\">function</span><span style=\"color:#009900\">(</span><span style=\"color:#009900\">)</span> <span style=\"color:#009900\">{</span> console.<span style=\"color:#660066\">log</span><span style=\"color:#009900\">(</span><span style=\"color:#000066;font-weight:bold\">this</span>.<span style=\"color:#000066\">name</span> <span style=\"color:#339933\">+</span> <span style=\"color:#3366cc\">&quot; says hello world&quot;</span><span style=\"color:#009900\">)</span><span style=\"color:#339933\">;</span> <span style=\"color:#009900\">}</span>\n<span style=\"color:#009900\">}</span>\n \n$<span style=\"color:#009900\">(</span><span style=\"color:#3366cc\">&quot;#some-div&quot;</span><span style=\"color:#009900\">)</span>.<span style=\"color:#660066\">click</span><span style=\"color:#009900\">(</span>person.<span style=\"color:#660066\">hello</span>.<span style=\"color:#660066\">bind</span><span style=\"color:#009900\">(</span>person<span style=\"color:#009900\">)</span><span style=\"color:#009900\">)</span><span style=\"color:#339933\">;</span>\n \n<span style=\"color:#006600;font-style:italic\">// when the div is clicked, &quot;Alex Russell says hello world&quot; is printed</span></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>This is, of course, somewhat clunky, and TC39 (the committee that works on the next version(s) of ECMAScript) continues to work on a more elegant, still-backwards-compatible solution.</p>\n<h1>On jQuery</h1>\n<p>Because jQuery makes such heavy use of anonymous callback functions, it uses the <code>call</code> method internally to set the <code>this</code> value of those callbacks to a more useful value. For instance, instead of receiving <code>window</code> as <code>this</code> in all event handlers (as you would without special intervention), jQuery invokes <code>call</code> on the callback with the element that set up the event handler as its first parameter.</p>\n<p>This is extremely useful, because the default value of <code>this</code> in anonymous callbacks is not particularly useful, but it can give beginners to JavaScript the impression that <code>this</code> is, <strong>in general</strong> a strange, often mutated concept that is hard to reason about.</p>\n<p>If you understand the basic rules for converting a sugary function call into a desugared <code>func.call(thisValue, ...args)</code>, you should be able to navigate the not so treacherous waters of the JavaScript <code>this</code> value.</p>\n<p><img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"http://yehudakatz.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/this-table2.png\" alt=\"this-table.png\" title=\"this-table.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"526\" height=\"195\"></p>\n<h1>PS: I Cheated</h1>\n<p>In several places, I simplified the reality a bit from the exact wording of the specification. Probably the most important cheat is the way I called <code>func.call</code> a \"primitive\". In reality, the spec has a primitive (internally referred to as <code>[[Call]]</code>) that both <code>func.call</code> and <code>[obj.]func()</code> use.</p>\n<p>However, take a look at the definition of <code>func.call</code>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If IsCallable(func) is false, then throw a TypeError exception.</li>\n<li>Let argList be an empty List.</li>\n<li>If this method was called with more than one argument then in left to right order starting with arg1 append each argument as the last element of argList</li>\n<li>Return the result of calling the [[Call]] internal method of func, providing thisArg as the this value and argList as the list of arguments.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As you can see, this definition is essentially a very simple JavaScript language binding to the primitive <code>[[Call]]</code> operation.</p>\n<p>If you look at the definition of invoking a function, the first seven steps set up <code>thisValue</code> and <code>argList</code>, and the last step is: \"Return the result of calling the [[Call]] internal method on func, providing thisValue as the this value and providing the list argList as the argument values.\"</p>\n<p>It's essentially identical wording, once the <code>argList</code> and <code>thisValue</code> have been determined.</p>\n<p>I cheated a bit in calling <code>call</code> a primitive, but the meaning is essentially the same as had I pulled out the spec at the beginning of this article and quoted chapter and verse.</p>\n<p>There are also some additional cases (most notably involving <code>with</code>) that I didn't cover here.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/KatzGotYourTongue?a=bKbTOr3MVfM:mbokqisykys:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/KatzGotYourTongue?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/KatzGotYourTongue/~4/bKbTOr3MVfM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

I posted a <a href=\"http://twitpic.com/5zilyp\">screencap</a> of \"Failed to load SELinux policy\" and a caption, which implied that SElinux people were worse than Lennart. Well, they weren't... A desperate run of grep across the whole root shows that that message comes from systemd. So, the apparent scenario is: the system boots with selinux=0, Lennart <i>ignores it</i>, tries to load SElinux policy anyway and fails, then aborts the boot. What a bummer; recovery is non-obvious. I am sorry to blame Morris, Walsh, and Co. for this debacle.</p>\n<p>UPDATE: I fixed it by rebuilding systemd with --disable-selinux. Now as a conscious hacker I should create a nice patch for selinux-setup.c that picks upon selinux=0 and submit it to Lennart's judgement.</p>\n<p>UPDATE: There was a bit of discussion in comments, which warrants some elaboration. First of all, Lennart is right not to bake kernel arguments into code and use selinux library. Instead, the failure of his logic happens in the following way. He invokes selinux_init_load_policy() and expects that it either works, or fails. If the library detects SELinux disabled, it returns success. However, the way in which it detects SElinux disabled is excessively roundabout, requiring magic mounts to happen, which can itself fail. When that happens, the whole system blows up, even though the breakage in SELinux components is entirely immaterial, due to it being disabled.</p>\n<p>UPDATE 20110922: An update to the bug <a href=\"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=727068\">727068</a> today:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If selinux=0 is passed to the kernel, then the mount point directory /sys/fs/selinux will not exist. selinux_init_load_policy() tries to mount selinuxfs on that directory, which will hence fail with ENOENT due to the missing mount point directory. In earlier versions when the file system was still mounted to /selinux the mount point dir always existed (since it was on the root disk, not in sysfs) and hence on selinux=0 ENODEV was returned when the mount was attempted. The function does check for ENODEV and handles things properly, but it doesn't do this for ENOENT.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The system continues to be unbootable (I use a local-built systemd with workarounds).</p>"

After testing tablets, now I am switching to smartphones. The methodology is the same: leveraging <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Dromaeo\">Dromaeo</a> set of <a href=\"http://dromaeo.com/?dom%7Cjslib%7Ccssquery\">DOM tests</a>.</p>\n<p>Here is the graph for the impatients:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-08Td4Y7fOgU/TjCTANGzz3I/AAAAAAAACDg/pC-VokAwZ28/s800/dromaeo-phones.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><span></span></p>\n<p>The full breakdown is also <a href=\"http://dromaeo.com/?id=145723,145724,145738,145744,145780\">available</a>, left-to-right: iPhone 4, Nexus S, Nokia N950, Galaxy S II, Palm Pre 2.</p>\n<p>(Special thanks to my linguist friend and self-proclaimed professional penguin lover <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sirspudd\">Donald Carr</a> for providing Galaxy S II result, my favorite web designer <a href=\"http://notes.jayrobinson.org/\">Jay Robinson</a> for letting me use his iPhone for few minutes, and a PreCentral forum member <a href=\"http://www.precentral.net/author/Grabber5.0\">Matt Williams</a> for sharing the Pre 2 data).</p>\n<p>It is better not to trust the numbers as exact scientific results, but more like a traditional rough estimate (the noise was quite high than usual, maybe because it is a phone and not only a simple tablet) . In all cases, it is pretty obvious that <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_S_II\">Galaxy S II</a> is screaming fast, possible due to its dual-core Exynos (aka Orion) CPU. The rest of the phones have <em>comparable</em> SoC: Cortex A8 at 1 GHz (just single core).</p>\n<p>Great respect to the folks behind the <a href=\"http://conversations.nokia.com/2011/06/28/nokia-n9-opening-the-browser/\">Harmattan browser</a> because N950 (<em>the</em> Qt phone) is in the same league as iPhone 4. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexus_S\">Nexus S</a>, once regarded as the best Android phone, quickly fades out, a proof that the Android world is moving at a crazy speed. Interesting to notice how Pre2 is better than Nexus S, though it does even have a lot of room of (software) improvements consider N950 can push the number by quite a margin.</p>\n<p>Of course, the fun part is now the extrapolated speculations we are obliged to make. There is no doubt that the upcoming iPhone 5 (or however it would be called) rumored to be announced in few months will likely raise the bar further. If you check previous <a href=\"http://ariya.ofilabs.com/2011/07/tablets-and-web-performance.html\">tablet comparison</a>, iPad 2 is the ultimate winner and there is no reason iPhone 5 can’t reach the same numbers. Having said that, an army of dual-core (and likely also quad-core) Android phones will force the numbers to march further, in a hope that this translates to a better user experience.</p>\n<p>Fun time ahead!</p>"

To do this, I use computer clusters like <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/\">Amazon's\nEC2</a> and a cluster at the <a href=\"http://hmdc.harvard.edu/\">Harvard MIT Data Center</a>. I will\nfrequently kick of a job to run overnight on the full HMDC cluster of\n~100 computers. Some of my friends do so nearly every night on similar\nclusters. Like many researchers and engineers, it costs me nothing to\nkick off a big job. That said, computers consume a lot of energy so I\ndid a little back-of-the-envelope calculation to figure out what the\ncost in terms of resources might add up to.</p>\n<p>An overnight job that uses a 100 computer cluster might use 800\ncomputer-hours. Although power efficiency varies hugely between\ncomputers, most statistical analysis is CPU intensive and should come\nclose to maximizing power consumption. According to a few sources\n[e.g., <a href=\"http://michaelbluejay.com/electricity/computers.html\">1</a> <a href=\"http://www.brighthub.com/environment/green-computing/articles/9351.aspx\">2</a> <a href=\"http://www.ehow.com/about_4693473_much-electricity-does-computer-use.html\">3</a>], 200 watts might be a conservative estimate\nof much a modern multi-CPU server will draw under high load and won't\ninclude other costs like cooling. Using this estimate, the overnight\njob on 100 machines would easily use 160 kilowatt hours (kWh) of\nenergy.</p>\n<p>In Massachusetts, most of our power comes from coal. <a href=\"http://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/energy/question481.htm\">This page</a>\nsuggests that an efficient coal plant will generate 2,460 kWh for each\nton of coal.  That means that one overnight job would use <em>59 kg (130\nlbs) of coal</em>.  In the process, you would also create 153 kg (338 lb)\nof CO2 and a bit under half a kilogram (about 1 lb) of nitrogen oxides\nand sulfur dioxide each. It's a <em>very</em> rough estimate but it certainly\ngenerates some pressure to make sure the research counts!</p>\n<p>Of course, I've written some free software that runs on many thousands\nof computers and servers. How many tons of coal are burnt to support\nlaziness or a lack of optimization in my software? What is the coal\ncost of choosing to write a program in a less efficient, but easier to\nwrite, higher-level programming languages like Python or Ruby instead\nof writing a more efficient version in C?</p>"

      "content" : "<p>As I was debugging something recently, an instruction popped up\nthat seemed a little incongruous:</p>\n\n<div>\n<pre>lea 0x0(%edi,%eiz,1),%edi\n</pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>Now this is an interesting instruction on a few levels.  Firstly,\n<tt>%eiz</tt> is a psuedo-register that simply equates to zero\nsomewhat like MIPS <tt>r0</tt>; I don't think it is really in common\nusage.  But when you look closer, this instruction is a fancy way of\ndoing nothing.  It's a little clearer in Intel syntax mode:</p>\n\n<div>\n<pre>lea    edi,[edi+eiz*1+0x0]\n</pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>So we can see that this is using scaled indexed addressing mode to\nload into <tt>%edi</tt> the value in <tt>%edi</tt> plus <tt>0 * 1</tt>\nwith an offset of <tt>0x0</tt>; i.e. put the value of <tt>%edi</tt>\ninto <tt>%edi</tt>, i.e. do nothing.  So why would this appear?</p>\n\n<p>What we can see from the disassembley is that this single\ninstruction takes up an impressive 7 bytes:</p>\n\n<div>\n<pre>8048489:\t8d bc 27 00 00 00 00\tlea    edi,[edi+eiz*1+0x0]\n</pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>Now, compare that to a standard <tt>nop</tt> which requires just a\nsingle byte to encode.  Thus to pad out 7 bytes of space would require\n7 <tt>nop</tt> instructions to be issued, which is a significantly\nslower way of doing nothing!  Let's investigate just how much...</p>\n\n<p>Below is a simple program that does nothing in a tight-loop;\nfirstly using <tt>nop</tt>s and then the <tt>lea</tt> do-nothing\nmethod.</p>\n\n<div>\n<pre>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n#include &lt;stdint.h&gt;\n#include &lt;time.h&gt;\n\ntypedef uint64_t cycle_t;\n\nstatic inline cycle_t\ni386_get_cycles(void)\n{\n        cycle_t result;\n        __asm__ __volatile__(&quot;rdtsc&quot; : &quot;=A&quot; (result));\n        return result;\n}\n\n#define get_cycles i386_get_cycles\n\nint main() {\n\n\tint i;\n\tuint64_t t1, t2;\n\n\tt1 = get_cycles();\n\n\t/* nop do nothing */\n\twhile (i &lt; 100000) {\n\t\t__asm__ __volatile__(&quot;nop;nop;nop&quot;);\n\t\ti++;\n\t}\n\tt2 = get_cycles();\n\tprintf(&quot;%ld\\n&quot;, t2 - t1);\n\n\ti = 0;\n\tt1 = get_cycles();\n\n\t/* lea do-nothing */\n\twhile (i &lt; 100000) {\n\t\t__asm__ __volatile__(&quot;lea 0x0(%edi,%eiz,1),%edi&quot;);\n\t\ti++;\n\t}\n\n\tt2 = get_cycles();\n\tprintf(&quot;%ld\\n&quot;, t2 - t1);\n}\n</pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>Firstly, you'll notice that rather than the 7-bytes mentioned\nbefore, we're comparing 3-byte sequences.  That's because the\nlea instruction ends up encoded as:</p>\n\n<div>\n<pre> 8048388:       8d 3c 27                lea    (%edi,%eiz,1),%edi\n</pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>When you hand-code this instruction, you can't actually convince\nthe assembler to pad out those extra zeros for the zero displacement\nbecause it realises it doesn't need them, so why would it waste the\nspace!  So, how did they get in there in the original disassembley?\nIf <tt>gas</tt> is trying to align something by padding, it has\nbuilt-in sequences for the most efficient way of doing that for\ndifferent sizes (you can see it in <tt>i386_align_code</tt> of <a href=\"http://www.wienand.org/vmware/vmware.html\">gas/config/tc-i386.c</a>\nwhich adds the extra 4 bytes in directly).</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, we can build and test this out (note you need the special\n<tt>-mindex-reg</tt> flag passed to <tt>gas</tt> to use the\n<tt>%eiz</tt> syntax):</p>\n\n<div>\n<pre>$ gcc -O3 -Wa,-mindex-reg  -o wait wait.c\n$ ./wait\n300072\n189945\n</pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>So, if you need 3-bytes of padding in your code for some reason,\nit's ~160% slower to pad out 3-bytes with no-ops rather than a single\nlarger instruction (at least on my aging Pentium M laptop).</p>\n\n<p>So now you can rest easy knowing that even though your code is\ndoing nothing, it is doing it in the most efficient manner\npossible!</p>"

      "content" : "<p>In the Debian boot system, several packages include scripts that\nare started from /etc/rcS.d/.  In fact, there is a bite more of them\nthan make sense, and this causes a few problems.  What kind of\nproblems, you might ask.  There are at least two problems.  The first\nis that it is not possible to recover a machine after switching to\nrunlevel 1.  One need to actually reboot to get the machine back to\nthe expected state.  The other is that single user boot will sometimes\nrun into problems because some of the subsystems are activated before\nthe root login is presented, causing problems when trying to recover a\nmachine from a problem in that subsystem.  A minor additional point is\nthat moving more scripts out of rcS.d/ and into the other rc#.d/\ndirectories will increase the amount of scripts that can run in\nparallel during boot, and thus decrease the boot time.</p>\n\n<p>So, which scripts should start from rcS.d/.  In short, only the\nscripts that _have_ to execute before the root login prompt is\npresented during a single user boot should go there.  Everything else\nshould go into the numeric runlevels.  This means things like\nlm-sensors, fuse and x11-common should not run from rcS.d, but from\nthe numeric runlevels.  Today in Debian, there are around 115 init.d\nscripts that are started from rcS.d/, and most of them should be moved\nout.  Do your package have one of them?  Please help us make single\nuser and runlevel 1 better by moving it.</p>\n\n<p>Scripts setting up the screen, keyboard, system partitions\netc. should still be started from rcS.d/, but there is for example no\nneed to have the network enabled before the single user login prompt\nis presented.</p>\n\n<p>As always, things are not so easy to fix as they sound.  To keep\nDebian systems working while scripts migrate and during upgrades, the\nscripts need to be moved from rcS.d/ to rc2.d/ in reverse dependency\norder, ie the scripts that nothing in rcS.d/ depend on can be moved,\nand the next ones can only be moved when their dependencies have been\nmoved first.  This migration must be done sequentially while we ensure\nthat the package system upgrade packages in the right order to keep\nthe system state correct.  This will require some coordination when it\ncomes to network related packages, but most of the packages with\nscripts that should migrate do not have anything in rcS.d/ depending\non them.  Some packages have already been updated, like the sudo\npackage, while others are still left to do.  I wish I had time to work\non this myself, but real live constrains make it unlikely that I will\nfind time to push this forward.</p>"

      "content" : "Anyone who's been following anything I've written lately may be under the impression that I dislike EFI. They'd be entirely correct. It's an awful thing and I've lost far too much of my life to it. It complicates the process of booting for no real benefit to the OS. The only real advantage we've seen so far is that we can configure boot devices in a vaguely vendor-neutral manner without having to care about BIOS drive numbers. Woo.<br><br>But there is something else EFI gives us. We finally have more than 256 bytes of nvram available to us as standard. Enough nvram, in fact, for us to reasonably store crash output. Progress!<br><br>This isn't a novel concept. The UEFI spec provides for a specially segregated are of nvram for hardware error reports. This is lovely and not overly helpful for us, because they're supposed to be in a well-defined format that doesn't leave much scope for \"I found a null pointer where I would really have preferred there not be one\" followed by a pile of text, especially if the firmware's supposed to do something with it. Also, the record format has lots of metadata that I really don't care about. Apple have also been using EFI for this, creating a special variable that stores the crash data and letting them get away with just telling the user to turn their computer off and then turn it back on again.<br><br>EFI's not the only way this could be done, either. ACPI specifies something called the ERST, or Error Record Serialization Table. The OS can stick errors in here and then they can be retrieved later. Excellent! Except ERST is currently usually only present on high-end servers. But when ERST support was added to Linux, a generic interface called pstore went in as well.<br><br>Pstore's very simple. It's a virtual filesystem that has platform-specific plugins. The platform driver (such as ERST) registers with pstore and the ERST errors then get exposed as files in pstore. Deleting the files removes the records. pstore also registers with kmsg_dump, so when an oops happens the kernel output gets dumped back into a series of records. I'd been playing with pstore but really wanted something a little more convenient than an 8-socket server to test it with, so ended up writing a pstore backend that uses EFI variables. And now whenever I crash the kernel, pstore gives me a backtrace without me having to take photographs of the screen. Progress.<br><br>Patches are <a href=\"https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/6/7/437\">here</a>. I should probably apologise to Seiji Aguchi, who was working on the same problem and posted a preliminary patch for some feedback last month. I replied to the thread without ever reading the patch and then promptly forgot about it, leading to me writing it all from scratch last week. Oops.<br><br>(There's an easter egg in the patchset. First person to find it doesn't win a prize. Sorry.)"

      "content" : "wxWidgets is notorious for using many macros. While evils of macros in C++ are well-known, sometimes they are really necessary, e.g. <tt>wxIMPLEMENT_APP</tt> hides the difference between using <tt>main()</tt> or <tt>WinMain()</tt> as entry point and sometimes, even if there are alternative approaches not involving macros, e.g. using <a href=\"http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_46_1/libs/utility/utility.htm#Class_noncopyable\">a base class</a> instead of <tt>wxDECLARE_NO_COPY_CLASS</tt> macro, their use is still not particularly offending. In still other cases macros are used to provide a kind of a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language\">DSL</a>, such as <a href=\"http://docs.wxwidgets.org/trunk/group__group__funcmacro__events.html\">event table macros</a> that allow to describe event handler connections statically and less flexibly but more concisely than <a href=\"http://wxwidgets.blogspot.com/2007/01/in-praise-of-connect.html\">Connect()</a>. <br><br>However in some cases there is really nothing that can be said in defense of<br>using the macros and they are present in the code just for \"historical<br>reasons\", i.e. because nobody thought about doing it better back when the code was first written, often enough almost 20 years ago. We try to deprecate (which is a polite term for \"get rid of\") such macros progressively and there are not that many of them left, at least on the interface side. <br><br>A couple of days ago I finally managed to ditch a particularly aggravating set of them: the so-called \"control container\" macros. They must be used in the classes that represent windows containing other windows (\"controls\") in order to allow <tt>TAB</tt> navigation inside them. While wxPanel and wxDialog, which are two of the usual control containers, already do it, you had to explicitly use macros such as <tt>WX_DECLARE_CONTROL_CONTAINER()</tt> and <tt>WX_DELEGATE_TO_CONTROL_CONTAINER()</tt> if you wanted to write your own composite controls. Luckily few people did this because these macros were not even documented but even just using them in wxWidgets itself causes much teeth gnashing. And particularly so from my part, almost surely because I wrote these macros myself (and only 10 years ago so even the \"explanation for using macros here is forever lost in the mists of time\" excuse is at most half-valid).<br><br>So when I had to add correct keyboard navigation to <tt>wxSearchCtrl</tt> to fix <a href=\"http://trac.wxwidgets.org/ticket/12808\">another bug</a>, I finally decided to atone for my mistake. The solution turned out to be surprisingly simple and nice: instead of all these macros I added a new <a href=\"http://docs.wxwidgets.org/trunk/classwx_navigation_enabled.html\">wxNavigationEnabled</a> class which uses <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curiously_recurring_template_pattern\">CRTP</a> to inject the TAB-handling logic into the derived class. So, as the example in the documentation shows, you now simply have to inherit your custom composite control from <tt>wxNavigationEnabled&lt;wxWindow&gt;</tt> instead of directly deriving from <tt>wxWindow</tt> to get correct keyboard handling, e.g.:<br><pre><code>class MyCompositeControl : wxNavigationEnabled {<br>    ...<br>};</code></pre><br><br>Using <tt>wxNavigationEnabled</tt> is definitely much simpler than using macros -- in fact, it's so simple that it could even finally be documented quite painlessly, which is a good criteria -- so I'm quite happy with it (as you can see, even happy enough to write a blog post about this). Even though not having to do anything at all and have TAB-navigation just work would certainly be even better, this can't be done without moving all the TAB navigation logic down into <tt>wxWindow</tt> itself and there are many, many windows which don't contain any other controls this doesn't look like a good idea.<br><br>Anyhow, this battle against macros was won but the war is not over yet. Getting rid of (or at least providing non preprocessor-based alternatives to) all macros in wxWidgets is not the highest priority issue but it's still nice to make some progress on it. And if you have any candidates for irritating macros to be dealt with next, please let us know!"

They are presented in an order that is\nrather logical, except the trigger axis is inserted between the two axis of the\nsecond stick.</p>\n\n<p>It also features two strange buttons:</p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>a “precision mode” switch, that is meant to “slow” the sticks,\n    restricting them to a narrow logical range to allow a precise aim:\n    this does not work at all, I suppose it requires some driver\n    support;</li>\n    <li>a “PC/PS3” switch that produces a disconnection and an immediate\n    reconnection and changes the events the pad reports: in PS3 mode,\n    the triggers axis disappears (and the two axis of the second stick\n    become consequently adjacent).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Game support</h2>\n\n<p>I only tested SuperTuxKart, but I think any game able to use a\ngamepad or a joystick should support it: after all, they all use the\nsame protocol. The default mapping is rather logical but I find it more\nconvenient to use the triggers rather than the main stick to accelerate\nand brake.</p>\n\n<p>I do not know if the vibration feature can be used at all, because I\ndo not know how it is exposed and I do not think I have any game that\nwould be able to take advantage of it.</p>\n\n<h2>X.Org support</h2>\n\n<p>This is an interesting feature: X.Org has a <em>joystick(4)</em> driver, available in the package <em>xserver-xorg-input-joystick</em> that allows you to use a\njoystick or a gamepad as an input device, both for pointing and typing.</p>\n\n<p>So, just for fun, I installed the <em>joystick</em>\ndriver. It installs a default configuration file as <em>/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-joystick.conf</em>, that is\nenough to provide features equivalent to a regular mouse.

Basically, since I was moving the app from Webrat, matchers like <code>assert_contain</code> and <code>assert_have_selector</code> are no longer available. Capybara’s <code>Node</code> class has a great <code>Matchers</code> mixin with <a href=\"http://rdoc.info/gems/capybara/1.0.0/Capybara/Node/Matchers\">tons of goodies</a> that can be used like so, in RSpec:</p>\n\n<pre><code>page.should have_content(\"This should be on the page\")\npage.should have_selector(\"a[href='http://thoughtbot.com']\")\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Great, but how does one use that in functional/controller tests?</p>\n\n<p>Enter <code>Capybara::Node::Simple</code>, which I found purely by chance when source diving. This class’ <a href=\"http://rdoc.info/gems/capybara/1.0.0/Capybara/Node/Simple\">docs</a> proclaim its usefulness:</p>\n\n<blockquote>It is useful in that it does not require a session, an application or a driver, but can still use Capybara’s finders and matchers on any string that contains HTML</blockquote>\n\n<p>Bingo! Now, how to use in our test suite? We’re still on Test::Unit for Gemcutter, so I had to do the following in <code>test/test_helper.rb</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Test::Unit::TestCase\n  def page\n    Capybara::Node::Simple.new(@response.body)\n  end\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now the Gemcutter test suite can do assertions like so:</p>\n\n<pre><code>assert page.has_content?(\"Rails (3.0.9)\")\nassert page.has_selector?(\"a[href='/gems/rails/versions/3.0.9']\")\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The whole diff is <a href=\"https://github.com/rubygems/gemcutter/commit/1a6a38c8d7515b7a00d4749fa1f3c638fb7e4a32\">on GitHub</a> if you’d like to see all of the changes of moving our functional tests from Webrat to Capybara.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://thoughtbot.com/about/#gberkewilliams\">Gabe</a> also found out that there’s also a shortcut in Capybara for creating a <code>Simple</code>: <code>Capybara.string</code>. The <a href=\"http://rdoc.info/gems/capybara/1.0.0/Capybara#string-class_method\">docs</a> for this show that it’s basically sugar on top of the <code>Simple</code> initializer:</p>\n\n<pre><code>node = Capybara.string &lt;&lt;-HTML\n  <ul>\n    <li>Home</li>\n    <li>Projects</li>\n  </ul>\nHTML\n\nnode.find(&#39;#projects&#39;).text # =&gt; &#39;Projects&#39;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I think this pattern is really useful not just for upgrading suites from Webrat, but really anywhere you have an HTML fragment or string that you’d like to use Capybara’s matchers on.</p>"

James already had a prototype in Haskell but it was too slow, so I rewrote it in node.js and wrote <a href=\"https://github.com/pkrumins/node-png\">several</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/pkrumins/node-gif\">C++</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/pkrumins/node-jpeg\">node.js</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/pkrumins/node-video\">modules</a> for fast encoding. In July we had a solid working prototype and I announced on my blog that I am doing the <a href=\"http://www.catonmat.net/blog/i-am-doing-a-startup/\">StackVM startup</a>. We had decided to apply to Winter 2010 YC, so we hacked some more, and applied to YC in October. I was super sure we'll get accepted as I had done various interesting projects in the past for <a href=\"http://www.catonmat.net/blog/designing-reddit-media-website/\">reddit</a>, <a href=\"http://www.catonmat.net/blog/designing-digg-picture-website/\">digg</a> (this project had <a href=\"http://www.catonmat.net/blog/few-words-about-digpicz-dot-com/\">100,000 visitors in 20 hours</a>), <a href=\"http://www.catonmat.net/blog/follow-hacker-news-from-the-console/\">hacker news</a>, I had over <a href=\"https://github.com/pkrumins\">50 unique projects on github</a> and my programming articles were getting <a href=\"http://www.catonmat.net/blog/three-years-of-blogging/\">millions of views</a>. I bought a ticket to USA on October 20, before the results were even announced. Meanwhile, James took a car trip from Alaska, where he was residing at the time, to Oakland. On October 27 I took a flight from Riga, where I live, to Frankfurt and then took a flight from Frankfurt to SFO and arrived there at around 9pm on October 28. Then I took BART to Oakland and met James for the first time. He was a good guy, so everything was fine.</p>\n<p>The YC results were to be announced on November 2. November 2 came and to our horrors they decided to pass on us and we didn't even get an interview. Here is our <a href=\"https://github.com/substack/stackvm/wiki/YC-Application\">YC application</a> and <a href=\"http://pkrumins.posterous.com/private/obrvzuHsbn\">2 minute YC video</a> if anyone is interested. The video isn't great but it was like the 100th time we tried to record it and we were out of energy to do more videos so we just went with what we had at 100th take.</p>\n<p>Fortunately for us, I had saved some money from all my previous jobs and my projects and decided to put $15,000 into our startup myself. I had been willing to do a real startup for years so I was fine with putting $15,000 in and we just started coding and not thinking about much else.</p>\n<p>James had heard about <a href=\"http://www.hackersandfounders.com/\">Hackers and Founders</a> meetup that&#39;s organized by Jonathan Nelson and Laura Nelson, so we decided to attend all the Hackers &amp; Founders meetups. When I first met Jonathan I was really surprised cause he knew me already from this blog! He had used my <a href=\"http://www.catonmat.net/blog/python-library-for-google-search/\">xgoogle Python library</a> for scraping Google search results for his <a href=\"http://newsley.com\">Newsley startup</a>. That was thrilling! The goal of this blog from the beginning was to get me well known and my blogging efforts had paid off. Success, I was known in the Silicon Valley! So we&#39;d continue to go to Hackers &amp; Founders meetups in SF and Mountain View, and we&#39;d show everyone we could what we had made, and things were going really well. People loved what we were doing and we didn&#39;t worry much about anything, we&#39;d just code and improve Browserling. We <a href=\"http://www.catonmat.net/blog/launching-browserling/\">launched beta</a> on November 24th and added paid plans in January. The moment we launched the paid plans we got our first customer, and then a few more, and then a few more, and by the end of January we had 10 paying customers already! Things were looking fantastic, but the time was ticking and the $15,000 was running out. It was now February and we had just a few $k left, so we decided it was time to raise money. At one of the Hackers &amp; Founders meetups Jonathan introduced us to <a href=\"http://www.ifindkarma.com/\">Adam Rifkin</a> and he was really excited about StackVM and Browserling. We told Adam that we were looking for a small investment of $50,000 that would keep us going, and he introduced us to <a href=\"http://david.weekly.org/\">David Weekly</a>. So we went and met with David Weekly and he was also really excited about Browserling. He was actually so excited that he wrote a check for us on the spot! Haha, how awesome is that! That's the Silicon Valley I had read about! A check on the spot!</p>\n<p>David Weekly decided to lead the investment round for us and help us structure the form of investment. We went with a convertible note, that's the best form of investment. He also introduced us to his friend Ulrich Gall. We took a trip to meet Ulrich Gall, talked for a few hours and we had another committed investor. We actually didn't have phones so he gave me a HTC Nexus One that he had gotten at one of TED conferences. Awesome! Now we were connected, too.</p>\n<p>David also got his girlfriend Rebecca Lipon to invest. Meanwhile Adam introduced us to Nick Heyman, who's friends with <a href=\"http://www.sowbug.org/\">Mike Tsao</a>. We met with Nick and Mike, and they agreed to invest as well. Mike loved that we had paying customers already.</p>\n<p>Now we had 5 investors but we didn&#39;t yet have a company! So we had to incorporate. We met with several lawyers from Orrick, Feynwick &amp; West, and some more, and we liked the lawyer from Fenwick &amp; West the most, so we went with him. A few days later we incorporated as Browserling INC. Then we took another trip to meet David Weekly and we signed the investment documents with him and Ulrich. On the same day David Weekly also interviewed us on his <a href=\"http://david.weekly.org/podcast/?p=episode&amp;name=2011-03-19_browserling.mp3\">The David Weekly podcast</a>. We were super excited. </p>\n<p>Next we setup our advisors. David Weekly, Jonathan Nelson, and Adam Rifkin were the most helpful and the awesome people we had met so we set them up as our advisors!</p>\n<p>At about the same time we also joined Jonathan and Laura Nelson's new startup incubator called <a href=\"http://hackersandfounders.tv/6BTA/hackers-founders/\">Co-Op</a>. We had discussed this with Jonathan before and we had said that if he ever did an incubator that we'd join in right away. And we did. We are the Reddit of Jonathan's incubator. Also it's funny how at first we didn't know what to call the incubator, so we called it secret super ninja turtles meetup. That's what I still call it when talking with James. :)</p>\n<p>That's the story. Now we're adding all kinds of cool features to Browserling. Just last week we launched tunnels for Browserling that allow you to access your localhost or local network from Browserling, and we're launching Testling soon, that's an automated test framework for Browserling.</p>\n<div><p><a href=\"http://www.browserling.com\"><img src=\"http://www.catonmat.net/images/browserling.png\"></a><br>\n<small><a href=\"http://www.browserling.com\">try browserling!</a></small></p>\n</div>\n<p>I have a dozen more blog posts prepared about Browserling. Such as how we open-sourced 40 node.js libraries, how open sourcing them made Browserling easy to maintain, how Browserling works internally, details of new features such as tunnels, resolution changing, testling. If you wish to hear more about it, I suggest that you <a href=\"http://www.catonmat.net/feed/\">subscribe to my blog</a> and/or <a href=\"http://twitter.com/pkrumins\">follow me on twitter</a>!</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/catonmat?a=_hpOArgyIa0:bQpWJi54nJs:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/catonmat?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/catonmat?a=_hpOArgyIa0:bQpWJi54nJs:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/catonmat?i=_hpOArgyIa0:bQpWJi54nJs:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/catonmat?a=_hpOArgyIa0:bQpWJi54nJs:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/catonmat?i=_hpOArgyIa0:bQpWJi54nJs:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/catonmat?a=_hpOArgyIa0:bQpWJi54nJs:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/catonmat?i=_hpOArgyIa0:bQpWJi54nJs:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/catonmat/~4/_hpOArgyIa0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

Since I wrote up what I wanted to say I figured I might as well blog it here. Warning: this is pretty unedited (or else it would never be published :-). I'm posting it in my \"personal\" blog instead of the \"Python history\" blog because it mostly touches on my career <i>before</i> Python. Here goes.<div><br></div><div><div>Have you ever written a computer program?

A few students had also used Python or Java.]</div></div><div><br></div><div>Have you ever invented a programming language? :-)</div><div><br></div><div>If you have programmed, you know some of the problems with programming languages. Have you ever thought about why programming isn't easier? Would it help if you could just talk to your computer? Have you tried speech recognition software? I have. It doesn't work very well yet. :-)</div><div><br></div><div>How do you think programmers will write software 10 years from now? Or 30? 50?</div><div><br></div><div>Do you know how programmers worked 30 years ago?</div><div><br></div><div>I do.</div><div><br></div><div>I was born in Holland in 1956.  Things were different.</div><div><br></div><div>I didn't know what a computer was until I was 18.  However, I tinkered with electronics.  I built a digital clock.  My dream was to build my own calculator.</div><div><br></div><div>Then I went to <a href=\"http://www.english.uva.nl/\">university</a> in Amsterdam to study mathematics and they had a <a href=\"http://60bits.net/\">computer</a> that was free for students to use!  (Not unlimited though.  We were allowed to use something like one second of CPU time per day. :-)</div><div><br></div><div>I had to learn how to use <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_card\">punch cards</a>.  There were machines to create them that had a keyboard.  The machines were as <a href=\"http://www.columbia.edu/cu/computinghistory/029.html\">big as a desk</a> and made a terrible noise when you hit a key: a small hole was punched in the card with a huge force and great precision.  If you made a mistake you had to start over.</div><div><br></div><div>I didn't get to see the actual computer for several more years. What we had in the basement of the <a href=\"http://staff.science.uva.nl/%7Epeter/portretpeter.jpg\">math department</a> was just an end point for a network that ran across the city.  There were card readers and line printers and operators who controlled them.  But the actual computer was elsewhere.</div><div><br></div><div>It was a huge, busy place, where programmers got together and discussed their problems, and I loved to hang out there.  In fact, I loved it so much I nearly dropped out of university.  But eventually I graduated.</div><div><br></div><div>Aside: Punch cards weren't invented for computers; they were invented for sorting census data and the like before WW2. [UPDATE: actually <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_card\">much earlier</a>, though the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_card#IBM_80_column_punched_card_format\">IBM 80-column format</a> I used did originate in 1928.]  There were large mechanical machines for sorting stacks of cards.  But punch cards are the reason that some software still limits you (or just defaults) to 80 characters per line.</div><div><br></div><div>My first program was a kind of \"hello world\" program written in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALGOL_60\">Algol-60</a>. That language was only popular in Europe, I believe.  After another student gave me a few hints I learned the rest of the language straight from the official definition of the language, the \"<a href=\"http://www.masswerk.at/algol60/report.htm\">Revised Report on the Algorithmic Language Algol-60</a>.\"  That was not an easy report to read!  The language was a bit cumbersome, but I didn't mind, I learned the basics of programming anyway: variables, expressions, functions, input/output.</div><div><br></div><div>Then a professor mentioned that there was a new programming language named Pascal.  There was a Pascal compiler on our mainframe so I decided to learn it.  I borrowed the <a href=\"http://www.anvari.org/fortune/Miscellaneous_Collections/228172_silver-book-n-jensen-and-wirths-infamous-pascal-user-manual-and-repo.html\">book</a> on Pascal from the departmental library (there was only one book, and only one copy, and I couldn't afford my own).  After skimming it, I decided that the only thing I really needed were the \"railroad diagrams\" at the end of the book that summarized the language's syntax.  I made photocopies of those and returned the book to the library.</div><div><br></div><div>Aside: Pascal really had only one new feature compared to Algol-60, pointers. These baffled me for the longest time. Eventually I learned assembly programming, which explained the memory model of a computer for the first time. I realized that a pointer was just an address. Then I finally understood them.</div><div><br></div><div>I guess this is how I got interested in programming languages.  I learned the other languages of the day along the way: Fortran, Lisp, Basic, Cobol.  With all this knowledge of programming, I managed to get a plum part-time job at the data center maintaining the mainframe's operating system.  It was the most coveted job among programmers.  It gave me access to unlimited computer time, the fastest terminals (still 80 x 24 though :-), and most important, a stimulating environment where I got to learn from other programmers.  I also got access to a Unix system, learned C and shell programming, and at some point we had an Apple II (mostly remembered for hours of playing space invaders).  I even got to implement a new (but very crummy) programming language!</div><div><br></div><div>All this time, programming was one of the most fun things in my life.  I thought of ideas for new programs to write all the time.  But interestingly, I wasn't very interested in using computers for practical stuff!  Nor even to solve mathematical puzzles (except that I invented a clever way of programming <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life\">Conway's Game of Life</a> that came from my understanding of using logic gates to build a binary addition circuit).</div><div><br></div><div>What I liked most though was write programs to make the life of programmers better.  One of my early creations was a text editor that was better than the system's standard text editor (which wasn't very hard :-).  I also wrote an archive program that helped conserve disk space; it was so popular and useful that the data center offered it to all its customers.  I liked sharing programs, and my own principles for sharing were very similar to what later would become Open Source (except I didn't care about licenses -- still don't :-).</div><div><br></div><div>As a term project I wrote a static analyzer for Pascal programs with another student. Looking back I think it was a horrible program, but our professor thought it was brilliant and we both got an A+. That's where I learned about parsers and such, and that you can do more with a parser than write a compiler.</div><div><br></div><div>I combined pleasure with a good cause when I helped out a small left-wing political party in Holland automate their membership database. This was until then maintained by hand as a collection of metal plates plates into which letters were stamped using an antiquated machine not unlike a steam hammer :-).  In the end the project was not a great success, but my contributions (including an emulation of Unix's venerable \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_%28text_editor%29\">ed</a>\" editor program written in Cobol) piqued the attention of another volunteer, whose day job was as computer science researcher at the Mathematical Center. (Now <a href=\"http://cwi.nl/\">CWI</a>.)</div><div><br></div><div>This was <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambert_Meertens\">Lambert Meertens</a>. It so happened that he was designing his own programming language, named B (later <a href=\"http://homepages.cwi.nl/%7Esteven/abc/\">ABC</a>), and when I graduated he offered me a job on his team of programmers who were implementing an interpreter for the language (what we would now call a virtual machine).</div><div><br></div><div>The rest I have <a href=\"http://python-history.blogspot.com/2009/01/personal-history-part-1-cwi.html\">written up earlier</a> in my Python history blog.</div></div>"

Let's build a Rack middleware and make it real for\nSinatra, Padrino and other Rack web frameworks!</p>\n\n<h3>Introducing rack-webconsole</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://codegram.github.com/rack-webconsole\">Rack-webconsole</a> is a Rack middleware that enhances your development experience\nproviding a JavaScript-powered bridge to your Ruby application backend.</p>\n\n<p>With it you can interact with your database and explore the runtime\nenvironment from within the browser. Although it should be used mainly in\ndevelopment environments, I personally think it could be a useful tool for\nstaging as well. Avoids the pain in the ass of interacting with some console\nover an SSH session :)</p>\n\n<p>Here you have a little video showing how it works (<strong>watch in HD, otherwise you won't see\nthe tiny letters</strong>!):</p>\n\n<iframe style=\"margin:0px auto\" width=\"700\" height=\"510\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/yKK5J01Dqts?hd=1\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n\n\n<p>Built from the ground up to be Rack-compliant, it has pretty much no\nconfiguration (other than including it in your Gemfile). So, let's give it a try:</p>\n\n<div><h5>Gemfile</h5><div>\n  <div><pre>gem <span><span>'</span><span>rack-webconsole</span><span>'</span></span></pre></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>Rack-webconsole <strong>needs JQuery</strong>. If you are using Rails 3, JQuery is loaded by\ndefault. In case you don't want to use JQuery in your application,\n<strong>rack-webconsole can inject it for you</strong> only when it needs it. To do that you\nshould put this line somewhere in your application (a Rails initializer, or\nsome configuration file):</p>\n\n<div><div>\n  <div><pre><span>Rack</span>::<span>Webconsole</span>.inject_jquery = <span>true</span></pre></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>If you are using Rails 3, you are done. Rack-webconsole comes with a Railtie\nthat automatically injects the gem into your middleware chain, and that's it!</p>\n\n<p>To fire up the console, <strong>just press the ` (backtick) key</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>And in case you are a Sinatra or Padrino user, you only have to specify that\nyou want to use this middleware:</p>\n\n<div><h5>sinatra_or_padrino_app.rb</h5><div>\n  <div><pre>require <span><span>'</span><span>sinatra</span><span>'</span></span>\nrequire <span><span>'</span><span>rack/webconsole</span><span>'</span></span>\n\n<span>class</span> <span>MySinatraApp</span> &lt; <span>Sinatra</span>::<span>Application</span>\n  use <span>Rack</span>::<span>Webconsole</span>\n  <span>\\</span><span># . . .</span>\n<span>end</span>\n\n<span>class</span> <span>SamplePadrino</span> &lt; <span>Padrino</span>::<span>Application</span>\n  use <span>Rack</span>::<span>Webconsole</span>\n  <span>\\</span><span># . . .</span>\n<span>end</span></pre></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>Manually requiring <code>rack-webconsole</code> is only needed if you are not using\nBundler.setup to initialize your dependencies in the app.</p>\n\n<p>You can check out the <a href=\"http://github.com/codegram/rack-webconsole\">github repo here</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>Behind the scenes</h3>\n\n<p>TL;DR: The idea behind rack-webconsole is simple: client-side JavaScript\ncommunicating with an IRB-esque server-side API which maintains state (i.e.\nlocal variables) across requests. The funny part it&#39;s all implemented behind a\nsingle Rack middleware, in that 90&#39;s Plug &amp; Play™ sense.</p>\n\n<p>For those who are curious, let's do a bit more of an in-depth explanation.\nLet's start with what Rack applications and middlewares are.</p>\n\n<h3>Rack applications and middlewares</h3>\n\n<p>As the <a href=\"http://rack.rubyforge.org/doc/files/SPEC.html\">Rack specification says</a>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>A Rack application is a Ruby object that respond to `call`. It takes\nexactly one argument, the environment, and returns an Array of exactly\nthree values: the status, the headers, and the body.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As an example, the following Ruby object is a fully-compliant Rack application:</p>\n\n<div><div>\n  <div><pre>lambda { |env| [<span>200</span>, {<span><span>'</span><span>Content-Type</span><span>'</span></span> =&gt; <span><span>'</span><span>text/plain</span><span>'</span></span>}, [<span><span>'</span><span>microsoft is so cool</span><span>'</span></span>]] }</pre></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>A Rack middleware is just a normal Rack application that is initialized from another Rack application and may manipulate its output (by output I mean\nstatus, headers or body). For example, let's build a middleware that filters\ngross words from the body:</p>\n\n<div><div>\n  <div><pre><span>class</span> <span>GrossFilter</span>\n  <span>\\</span><span># This is the Rack application from which we take the response.</span>\n  <span>def</span> <span>initialize</span>(app)\n    <span>@app</span> = app\n  <span>end</span>\n\n  <span>def</span> <span>call</span>(env)\n    status, headers, body = <span>@app</span>.call(env) <span>\\</span><span># Get the original response</span>\n\n    <span>\\</span><span># Filter out gross words from the body</span>\n    modified_body = body.map <span>do</span> |response_line|\n      response_line.gsub(<span><span>'</span><span>microsoft</span><span>'</span></span>, <span><span>'</span><span>'</span></span>)\n    <span>end</span>\n\n    <span>\\</span><span># Return the modified response</span>\n    [status, headers, modified_body]\n  <span>end</span>\n<span>end</span></pre></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>On every request, our middleware chain will look like this:</p>\n\n<p style=\"overflow:hidden;text-align:center\">\n   <img src=\"http://f.cl.ly/items/0N3V033x0t0d3N1o1C1h/middleware_chain.png\" style=\"float:none\">\n</p>\n\n\n<h3>Rack-webconsole internals</h3>\n\n<p>Rack-webconsole is a middleware that hides two different middlewares inside:\nthe asset injecter and the server-side console service.</p>\n\n<p>When the browser is requesting an HTML view, the asset injecter injects the\nconsole HTML, CSS and JavaScript code in the view.</p>\n\n<p>Then, whenever the client-side JavaScript performs an AJAX call to the\nserver-side console (in path '/webconsole'), the server-side console returns\nevaluated Ruby as JSON.</p>\n\n<p style=\"overflow:hidden;text-align:center\">\n  <img src=\"http://f.cl.ly/items/2G3V210H2J0u2J0G140r/rack-webconsole_internals.png\" style=\"float:none\">\n</p>\n\n\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n\n<p>Rack middlewares are simple yet powerful tools worth adding to your stack. But\nwe just saw they are not only valuable in production! Can you think of other\ndevelopment-oriented tools that could fit as a nice, pluggable Rack middleware?\nNow you can get an idea of how simple it is to write them :)</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/codegram/~4/LSXnmfGjsAQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

Instead, the reasons were fully\ntechnical: glibc past some particular version needs TLS (thread-local\nstorage) support, which hadn't been implemented for m68k yet, and nobody\nwithin the Debian/m68k team had the expertise to work on this. That was\nall.</p>\n<p>Not so long ago, some people within RedHat had started doing a TLS\nimplementation for m68k, however. This was paid for by one of their\ncustomers who needed the ColdFire to work, and therefore it was focused\nmostly on ColdFire. However, ColdFire is close enough to plain old m68k\nthat it was possible to port this TLS support to plain old without too\nmuch effort. Unfortunately, most of our machines were pretty much\nnonfunctional by that time; so in order to get things to work, we'd have\nto</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reinstall some of our machines, fix the others, <em>without</em> a\nfunctional installer,</li>\n<li>Do the necessary porting and package integration work,</li>\n<li>Rebootstrap the architecture,</li>\n<li>do other things necessary (such as providing a working installer,\netc).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Not quite impossible, but still a lot of work that would need someone\nto put in quite an amount of time. This wasn't something that people in\nthe m68k port could invest; and I'm also not sure we had the necessary\nskills amongst the team to do the necessary porting.</p>\n<p>So the work lay there, and it wasn't being done. Until one Thorsten\nGlaser, author of a shell called 'mksh' that I hadn't heard of until\nthen, came along, and noted that his mksh package wasn't being built for\nm68k. Upon investigating, he discovered, as expected, that the port was\nalmost dead. Now most people would leave it at that and decide that they\ncouldn't build for an architecture that wasn't being maintained\nanymore—and that would be perfectly fine— but not Thorsten.\nOn the brink of death, he almost single-handedly revived the m68k port,\nand got stuff to work to such an extent that it is now again possible to\nbuild a working and fairly up-to-date Linux/m68k <a href=\"http://packages.debian.org/aranym\">ARAnyM</a> virtual machine.</p>\n<p>As I'm typing this, my ARAnyM instance is checking out the d-i\nrepository (so I can start building d-i), <em>and</em> building sudo at\nthe same time.</p>\n<p>Let's see what comes from this.</p>"

No, I hadn’t. I switched on the TV, and went to <a href=\"http://www.nrk.no\">www.nrk.no</a> to find out what had happened.</p>\n<p>At first glance, it seemed that Norway had gotten away lucky: An apparently huge blast, in the capital’s centre, almost at rush hour, yet only seven dead. I texted my friends in Oslo and even though they are living or working near the blast site, they and theirs were unharmed.</p>\n<p>That was then.</p>\n<p>As I write this, we’re up to almost a hundred dead, with quite a few persons still unaccounted for. We know that the bombing in Oslo was just the prelude for a killing spree on Utøya, where a peaceful youth-get-together was underway. We know that the — predictable — initial commentators blaming Islamic terror were, for once, wrong, and we have to deal with the fact that this was an act by a Norwegian (dare I say Arian?) who cut’n&#39;pasted together a 1500-page manifest while planning the killing for nine years.</p>\n<p>But I don’t want to speculate on politics and police tactics.</p>\n<p>My thoughts go out, instead, to the Norwegian people. Many will find that they have lost someone they knew, or know someone who lost someone, when the names of the victims will be published after their next-of-kins have been informed.</p>\n<p>I’m desperately hoping that none of my friends and none of the Trolls will be among those. That’s selfish, in a way, but it’s all I’m currently capable of. The rest is deep sadness, and the hope that Norway doesn’t come out of this changed to the worse, and instead will continue to be the <a href=\"http://theforeigner.no/pages/news/un-says-norway-still-best-place-to-live/\">best country in the world to live in</a>.</p>\n<br>Filed under: <a href=\"http://marcmutz.wordpress.com/category/english/\">English</a>  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/marcmutz.wordpress.com/247/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/marcmutz.wordpress.com/247/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/marcmutz.wordpress.com/247/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/delicious/marcmutz.wordpress.com/247/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gofacebook/marcmutz.wordpress.com/247/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/facebook/marcmutz.wordpress.com/247/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gotwitter/marcmutz.wordpress.com/247/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/twitter/marcmutz.wordpress.com/247/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/marcmutz.wordpress.com/247/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/stumble/marcmutz.wordpress.com/247/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/marcmutz.wordpress.com/247/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/digg/marcmutz.wordpress.com/247/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/marcmutz.wordpress.com/247/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/reddit/marcmutz.wordpress.com/247/\"></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=marcmutz.wordpress.com&amp;blog=14776649&amp;post=247&amp;subd=marcmutz&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><div></div>"

But one of the side effects of the recrudescence of <a href=\"http://www.tt-solutions.com/en/articles/diving_into_modern_perl\">my love affair with Perl</a> is that I'm looking for excuses to write more Perl code and so I spent half an hour today on writing a <a href=\"http://www.tt-solutions.com/en/portfolio/trac_ticket_stats\">small script</a> allowing to gather ticket statistics automatically. This is probably not the best way to do it (it would be better to install some Trac statistics plugin server-side) and the script itself is pretty trivial so it didn't quench my quest for more Perl neither but at least it does quickly give the statistics I wanted.<br><br>The bad part is that I didn't want the statistics I got because it in spite of all our efforts the number of opened bugs in wxWidgets keeps increasing. The only good news is that the rate of increase seems to have decreased or at least stabilized: if in 2009 we had 271 new bugs (computed as the difference between 1270 opened and 145 reopened ones and 1144 closed ones), in 2010 we had \"only\" 275 new bugs and so far in 2011 we have only 20 news ones (and it's not as people got simply tired of reporting them, there were still 521 newly opened bugs since the beginning of the year). But in all, we still have 544 more bugs today than in May 2008 when Trac statistics begin so the journey towards bug-free future remains long...<br><br>Out of curiosity I also collected the month statistics using the following intimidating command combining the wonders of <a href=\"http://www.zsh.org/\">zsh</a> short loop syntax and GNU date <a href=\"http://www.gnu.org/s/coreutils/manual/html_node/Relative-items-in-date-strings.html#Relative-items-in-date-strings\">relative dates support</a>:<br><pre><code><br>% for ((year=2008;$year&lt;=2011;year++)); \\<br>  for ((i=1;$i&lt;=12;i++)); \\<br>  ./trac-ticket-stats --csv trac.wxwidgets.org $year-$i-01 \\<br>    `date --date=\"1 day ago 1 month $year-$i-01\" +%F`<br></code></pre><br>and discovered somewhat surprising variations between the months: on average, we get 60 net new tickets per month but there are some outliers. In Januaries there are almost no new bugs (2) while in October there are 112 of them. Looking at the number of bugs created, more bugs are created in March, October and July (which are very close) while wxWidgets users seem to be on vacation in June when almost twice less bugs are opened. As for us, the developers, we seem to start every new year with good resolutions as January is the month with by far the most bug fixes while by June working on them really loses its appeal and two times fewer of them are resolved."

      "content" : "<h1>why proprietary relicensing is unacceptable for a Free Software\nenthusiast</h1>\n<p>The past few months have witnessed a large debate about\ncopyright assignment, which seems to has neared its peak around the\ntime <a href=\"http://harmonyagreements.org/\">Project Harmony</a>\nhas released version 1.0 of its agreement templates. (Note: I use\nthe expression \"copyright assignment\" in this post, but I'd happily\ninclude into it both actual Copyright Assignment Agreements — CCAs\n— and Contributor License Agreements — CLAs, as both could be used\nto permit various forms of proprietary relicensing.)</p>\n<p>Mark Shuttleworth has been one of the most prominent voices\ncampaigning in favor of copyright assignments (to for-profit\ncompanies). A couple of interesting blog posts of his where this is\nevident are <a href=\"http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/680\">\"On balancing\neconomic power in the FLOSS ecosystem\"</a> and <a href=\"http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/687\">\"The\nresponsibilities of ownership\"</a>. Voices against the opportunity\nof increasing the popularity of copyright assignments are aplenty\nand it is pointless to repeat good arguments which I find fully\nconvincing. If you are interested in the subject, here are a few\n<strong>good reads</strong> I recommend:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://people.gnome.org/~michael/blog/copyright-assignment.html\"><em>\n\"Some thougts on copyright assignment\"</em></a>, seminal essay\n(circa end of 2009) by Michael Meeks that provides a good coverage\nof copyright assignment basics and effects on the surrounding\necosystem</li>\n<li>Richard Fontana's <a href=\"http://opensource.com/law/11/7/trouble-harmony-part-1\"><em>\"The\ntrouble with Harmony\"</em></a>; in particular, I recommend taking a\nclose look at <em>\"The illusion of constraint\"</em> part</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What I would like to add to the debate is the point of view of a\nFree Software enthusiast, not unlike yours truly. I contribute to\nFree Software not because it is superior to proprietary software in\neither its software products or in its development methodology. (It\nactually is superior in many cases, but that's just not my primary\nmotivation.) I do contribute to Free Software to build a world in\nwhich users are in complete control of the software they run.</p>\n<p>Let's assume we have a <strong>broken toaster</strong> at home.\nWe are all free to (1) open it up and try to repair it by\nourselves. If we don't have the needed knowledge, we are free to\n(2) hand it over to a person that we trust and who does have the\nneeded knowledge to repair it. That failing, we can (3) ask the\ntoaster producer to repair it for us. Many people like me simply\ndon't accept to live in a world where, once all the toasters will\nbe software-driven, the only repair option will be (3), just\nbecause the toaster software is proprietary. (Given various kind of\n[broken] metaphors have been used to explain copyright assignments,\nit seemed sensible to propose my broken toaster metaphor in\nexchange.)</p>\n<p>When I contribute to some Free Software project, I not only care\nabout being able <em>myself</em> to get a Free Software licensed\ncopy of the whole product (i.e. the original software product + my\nown contribution). I care that <em>all</em> recipients of the\nproduct, present and future, will be able to get that contribution\nwith enough freedoms attached to put them in control of the\nsoftware that includes it. This desire can be fulfilled with a\nvarying degree of success, depending on the license of the code\nbase I contribute to. For instance, I find more pleasant to\ncontribute to a copyleft licensed code base than to a\nweak-/non-copyleft licensed one, and more pleasant to contribute to\nan AGPL-ed web app than to a copyleft web app. It also means that,\ngiven the option, I will not allow the code base maintainer to\nre-license my contribution under terms that allow distributing it\nwithout suitable freedoms attached.</p>\n<p>Different contributors will be ready to accept different\nre-licensing promises, but the mere fact we are debating all this —\nand that companies like Canonical feel <em>the need of campaigning\nfor copyright assignments</em> — is evidence that many contributors\nlike me exists and actually have a problem with allowing downstream\nrelicensing of their contributions. What is feared the most is of\ncourse <strong>proprietary relicensing</strong>. According to my\nmoral horizon this is the case not because the company might end up\ngaining money out of my code: I wouldn't have a problem with that.\nThe reason is rather that the company will be able to distribute my\nown code in a way that grants less freedoms to users than those\nthat were implicitly \"agreed upon\" when the contribution has been\nwritten.</p>\n<p>In that respect, I can't help thinking at <strong>harmony\nagreements</strong> as a large scale smoke screen experiment meant\nto convince volunteers that copyright assignments are something\nFree Software <em>needs</em>. By exploiting the\ncreative-commons-like <a href=\"http://selector.harmonyagreements.org/\">\"it's easy, just choose\none\" scheme</a>, Harmony takes the chance of offering misleading\noptions such as the one labeled \"any OSI approved license\". Via\nthat option, which is seemingly fine, the copyright recipient will\nbe allowed to relicense the contribution under some non-copyleft\nlicense (e.g. BSD) and from there do essentially what they\nwant.</p>\n<p>All in all, companies campaigning for copyright assignments seem\nto have failed to understand two main points. The first one is that\ncontributors motivated by Free Software ideals want the code to\nremain free not only for themselves, but for all recipients of the\ncode. I'm not claiming that all contributors to FOSS projects\nbelong to this category, but the fact that there is a considerable\namount of such people is undeniable. Hoping that they will be\nfooled by tricks like the \"any OSI approved license\" agreement is\nfoolish.</p>\n<p>The second is that while volunteer Free Software communities do\nrespect companies that provide huge amounts of code contributions,\nthey also expect companies to figure out by themselves which\nbusiness models make their businesses sustainable. Telling\nvolunteers that current business models are not sustainable without\nproprietary relicensing is worthless. Volunteers just don't care.\nThey want software freedom guarantees and are not willing to\nrenounce to them in exchange of the wealth of companies, not even\nunder the (implicit) threat that otherwise those companies will be\nforced to reduce the amount of their code contributions.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> explain in the initial note why my\nreasoning here encompasses both CCAs and CLAs. Thanks Tollef for\nnoticing that it wasn't clear.</p>"

Unfortunately, despite puting in way too much time that I\ndon't have, no really good solution appeared.

So now we have\npretty much figured out the equipment and settled on a configuration.\nWe'll have 2 Nokia Metrosite BTS with a total of 5 TRX, each running at\n5W using borrowed equipment.\n</p>\n<p>\nDuring the next 10 days, all the parts like antennas, cabling, plugs,\nadapters and the BTS units themselves should arrive at my place.

The Nokia A-bis support in OpenBSC will be brand new, so there\nmight be some glitches here and there.  But then, that's part of the\nfun.  I'm already very curious to see what kind of coverage we get.  I\nguess if we do things right, it should reach well into Finowfurt itself,\nand not just barely cover the camp grounds like we had at HAR 2009.\n</p>"

      "content" : "<p>“Child pornography is great,” the man said enthusiastically. “Politicians do not understand file sharing, but they understand child pornography, and they want to filter that to score points with the public. Once we get them to filter child pornography, we can get them to extend the block to file sharing.”</p>\n <p>The date was May 27, 2007, and the man was Johan Schlüter, head of the Danish Anti-Piracy Group (<em>Antipiratgruppen</em>). He was speaking in front of an audience from which the press had been banned; it was assumed to be copyright industry insiders only. It wasn’t. Christian Engström, who’s now a Member of the European Parliament, Oscar Swartz, and I <a href=\"http://christianengstrom.wordpress.com/2010/04/27/ifpis-child-porn-strategy/\">were</a> <a href=\"http://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;sl=sv&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fcomputersweden.idg.se%2F2.2683%2F1.111214\">also</a> <a href=\"http://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;sl=sv&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Ffalkvinge.net%2F2008%2F02%2F07%2Fkommentarer-till-propagandakriget%2F\">there</a>.</p>\n<p>“My friends,” Schlüter said. “We must filter the Internet to win over online file sharing. But politicians don’t understand that file sharing is bad, and this is a problem for us. Therefore, we must associate file sharing with child pornography. Because that’s something the politicians understand, and something they want to filter off the Internet.”</p>\n<p>“We are developing a child pornography filter in cooperation with the IFPI and the MPA so we can show politicians that filtering works,” he said. “Child pornography is an issue they understand.” Schlüter grinned broadly.</p>\n<p>I couldn’t believe my ears as I heard this the first time. But the strategy has been set into motion worldwide.</p>\n<p>Schlüter’s plan worked like clockwork. Denmark was the first country to censor AllOfMP3.com, the (fully legal) Russian music store, and is now censoring The Pirate Bay off the internet. The copyright industry is succeeding in creating a fragmented Internet.</p>\n<p>This is why you see the copyright lobby bring up child pornography again and again and again. They are using it as a battering ram for censoring any culture outside of their own distribution channels. You can Google the term together with any copyright lobby organization and see them continuously coming back to it.</p>\n<p>In Sweden, the copyright industry lobbyist Per Strömbäck has publicly admitted it being one of his best arguments. Try Googling for the Swedish word for child pornography on the lobby site and see if you get <a href=\"http://www.google.com/#sclient=psy&amp;hl=en&amp;source=hp&amp;q=barnporr+site:netopia.se&amp;pbx=1&amp;oq=barnporr+site:netopia.se&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=undefined&amp;gs_sm=e&amp;gs_upl=296883l300642l6l9l8l1l0l0l4l1537l2707l0.3.0.2.8-1l7&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.&amp;fp=7c469d2a1253a36a&amp;biw=1337&amp;bih=565\">any hits in any articles</a> (over 40).</p>\n<p>The reasoning is simple and straightforward. Once you have established that someone who is in a position to censor other people’s communication has a responsibility to do so, the floodgates open and those middlemen can be politically charged with filtering anything that somebody objects to being distributed.</p>\n<p><strong>It is not hard to see why the copyright lobby is pursuing this avenue so ferociously.</strong></p>\n<p>It doesn’t really matter that filters at the DNS level are ridiculously easy to circumvent. The idea is to create a political environment where censorship of undesirable information is seen as something natural and positive. Once that principle has been established, the next step is to force a switch to more efficient censorship filters at the IP or even the content level.</p>\n<p>News reached us this week that Internet Service Providers in the <strong>United States</strong> have now entered an agreement with the copyright lobby to police the net. This arrangement, it turns out, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/08/technology/to-slow-piracy-internet-providers-ready-penalties.html?_r=1\">also stems</a> from the copyright industry’s love of child pornography.</p>\n<p><em>“We pointed out to [the governor] that there are overlaps between the child porn problem and piracy,” Mr. Sherman [The RIAA president] said, “because all kinds of files, legal and otherwise, are traded on peer-to-peer networks.”</em></p>\n<p>Sound familiar? It should. It’s a page right out of the 2007 scene where the Danish Mr. Schlüter talked about the copyright lobby’s policymaking strategy of associating non-monopolistic distribution of culture with the rape of small defenseless children.</p>\n<p><strong>This association strategy has now worked in the United States, too.</strong></p>\n<p>Just when you think the copyright lobby can’t sink any lower, they surprise you again. And it gets worse. Much worse.</p>\n<p>In Europe, the copyright lobby is now pushing Commissioner Malmström to create <a href=\"http://christianengstrom.wordpress.com/category/informationspolitik/censilia/\">a similar censorship regime</a>, despite <a href=\"http://falkvinge.net/2011/04/14/european-court-of-justice-to-outlaw-internet-filtering-esp-for-copyright-enforcement/\">clear setbacks</a> from the European Court of Justice defending human rights and freedom to communicate.</p>\n<p>But taking one step back, would censorship of child pornography be acceptable in the first place? Is the copyright industry perhaps justified in this particular pursuit, beyond their real goal of blocking non-monopolistic distribution?</p>\n<p>There are two layers of answers to that. The first is the principal one, whether pre-trial censorship is ever correct. History tells us that it plainly isn’t, not under any circumstance.</p>\n<p>But more emotionally, we turn to a German group named <a href=\"http://mogis-verein.de/eu/en/\">Mogis</a>. It is a support group for adult people who were abused as children, and is the only one of its kind. They are very outspoken and adamant on the issue of censoring child pornography.</p>\n<p><strong>Censorship hides the problem and causes more children to be abused</strong>, they say. <strong>Don’t close your eyes, but see reality and act on it.</strong> As hard as it is to force oneself to be confronted emotionally with this statement, it is rationally understandable that a problem can’t be addressed by hiding it. One of their slogans is “Crimes should be punished and not hidden”.</p>\n<p>This puts the copyright industry’s efforts in perspective. In this context they <strong>don’t care in the slightest</strong> about children, only about their control over distribution channels. If you ever thought you knew cynical, this takes it to a whole new level.</p>\n<p>The conclusion is as unpleasant as it is inevitable. <strong>The copyright industry lobby is actively trying to hide egregious crimes against children, obviously not because they care about the children, but because the resulting censorship mechanism can be a benefit to their business if they manage to broaden the censorship in the next stage.</strong> All this in defense of their lucrative monopoly that starves the public of culture.</p>\n<p>It’s hard to comprehend that there are people who are so shameless that they would actually do this. But there are. Every time you think the copyright lobby has sunk as morally low as is humanly possible, they prove you wrong.</p>\n<p>— — —</p>\n<p><em>Rick Falkvinge is a regular columnist on TorrentFreak, sharing his thoughts every other week.

      "content" : "<p></p><p>Some time ago, Gunnar <a href=\"http://labs.qt.nokia.com/2011/05/31/qml-scene-graph-in-master/\">presented to you</a> what the new QML Scene Graph is all about. As mentioned in that article, one of the new features is a new technique for text rendering based on distance field alpha testing. This technique allows us to leverage all the power of OpenGL and have text like we never had before in Qt: scalable, sub-pixel positioned and sub-pixel antialiased… and at almost no cost.</p>\n<p>First, here is a video showing the improvements this technique brings:</p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>Distance Field… Huh?</h1>\n<p>Now, most of you are probably wondering what a distance field is. Also known as distance transform or distance map, it is a derived representation of a digital image that maps each pixel to a value representing the distance to the closest edge of the glyph. On a range from 0.0 to 1.0, a pixel on the edge of the glyph should have a value of 0.5, a pixel outside the shape should have a value going towards 0.0 as the distance from the nearest edge increases, a pixel inside the shape should have a value going towards 1.0 as the distance from the nearest edge increases.</p>\n\n<a href=\"http://labs.qt.nokia.com/2011/07/15/text-rendering-in-the-qml-scene-graph/glyph_norm_inv/\" title=\"Normal representation of the glyph\"><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"http://labs.qt.nokia.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/glyph_norm_inv.png\" alt=\"Normal representation of the glyph\" title=\"Normal representation of the glyph\"></a>\n<a href=\"http://labs.qt.nokia.com/2011/07/15/text-rendering-in-the-qml-scene-graph/glyph_df_inv/\" title=\"Distance field\"><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"http://labs.qt.nokia.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/glyph_df_inv.png\" alt=\"Distance field\" title=\"Distance field\"></a>\n<a href=\"http://labs.qt.nokia.com/2011/07/15/text-rendering-in-the-qml-scene-graph/glyph_outline_over/\" title=\"Distance field with outline\"><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"http://labs.qt.nokia.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/glyph_outline_over.png\" alt=\"Distance field with outline\" title=\"Distance field with outline\"></a>\n\n<p>A distance field can be generated either from a high-resolution image or from a vector-based representation of the glyph. The first solution is typically based on a brute-force method and can potentially be very slow, thus it is hardly conceivable to use this solution in our case when we have dozens of glyphs (or even hundreds in the case of Chinese) to generate at once. Some tools (like <a href=\"http://bitsquid.blogspot.com/2010/04/distance-field-based-rendering-of.html\">this one</a>) allow to pre-render a set of glyphs from a given font into a file to be then used at run-time, but we didn’t choose this solution as it gives poor flexibility to developers.</p>\n<p>We chose instead to use a vector-based representation of the glyph to generate the distance data. Put simply, we extrude the outline of the glyph by a fixed distance on the inside and on the outside and fill the area between the extruded outlines with a distance gradient. We store the result in a single 8-bit channel of a 64×64 pixels cell contained in a bigger texture. By doing so we manage, thanks to Kim, to generate a distance field in less than a millisecond per glyph on a mobile device (on average), making any vector font usable dynamically at run-time.</p>\n<h1>How Does It Work</h1>\n<p>This technique allows to take advantage of the native bilinear interpolation performed by the GPU on the texture. The distance from the edge can be accurately interpolated, allowing to reconstruct the glyph at any scale factor. All we need to do is alpha-testing: pixels are shown or discarded depending on a threshold, typically 0.5 as it is the value at the edge of the glyph. The result is a glyph with sharp outlines at any level of zoom, as if they were vector graphics. The only flaw is that it cuts off sharp corners, but this is negligible considering how bad a magnified glyph looks when this technique is not used.</p>\n\n<a href=\"http://labs.qt.nokia.com/?attachment_id=6264\" title=\"no_df\"><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"http://labs.qt.nokia.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/no_df.png\" alt=\"20 px Glyph Magnified 10x Without Distance Field\" title=\"no_df\"></a>\n<a href=\"http://labs.qt.nokia.com/?attachment_id=6263\" title=\"df_no_aa\"><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"http://labs.qt.nokia.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/df_no_aa.png\" alt=\"20 px glyph magnified 10x with distance field and alpha-testing, using an input texture of the same size\" title=\"df_no_aa\"></a>\n\n<p>This technique provides a great visual improvement while not affecting performance at runtime as everything is done “for free” by the graphics hardware.</p>\n<h1>Improvements</h1>\n<h3>High-Quality Anti-Aliasing</h3>\n<p>Using the same distance field representation of the glyph, we can also do high-quality anti-aliasing using a single line of shader code:</p>\n<pre>varying highp vec2 sampleCoord;\nuniform sampler2D texture;\nuniform lowp vec4 color;\nuniform highp float distMin;\nuniform highp float distMax;\nvoid main() {\n    gl_FragColor = color * smoothstep(distMin, distMax, texture2D(texture, sampleCoord).a);\n}</pre>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Instead of using a single threshold to do alpha-testing, we now use two distance thresholds that the shader uses to soften the edges. The input distance field value is interpolated between the two thresholds with the <em>smoothstep</em> function to remove aliasing artifacts. The width of the soft region can be adjusted by changing the distance between the two thresholds. The more the glyph is minified, the wider the soft region is. The more the glyph is magnified, the thinner the soft region is.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://labs.qt.nokia.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/df_gray_aa.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\"></p>\n<p>When the GPU is powerful enough (meaning desktop GPUs) we can even do sub-pixel anti-aliasing, it is just about adding some lines of shader code. Instead of using the distance data to compute the output pixel’s alpha, we use the data of the neighboring pixels to compute each color component of the output pixel separately. Five texture samples are then needed instead of one. The red component averages the three left-most distance field values, the green component averages the three middle distance field values and the blue component averages the three right-most distance field values. Because this requires more processing power, sub-pixel anti-aliasing is currently disabled on mobile platforms. Anyway, the high pixel density displays that equips mobile devices nowadays make the use of sub-pixel anti-aliasing pointless.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://labs.qt.nokia.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/df_subpix_aa.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\"></p>\n<h3>Special Effects</h3>\n<p>In addition to anti-aliasing, the distance field can be used, again with just a few lines of shader code, to do some special effects like outlining, glows or drop shadows. We are then able to implement the three styles provided by the QML <em>Text</em> element (outline, raised and sunken) using that technique. For example to do outlining, we just have to use a different color for the texels which are between two distance values. Effectively, it makes the use of these effects faster, nicer and scalable (scaling a styled text in QtQuick 1.0, not Scene Graph based, gives very poor quality).</p>\n<h1>Implementation Details</h1>\n<p>For a given font, we rasterize and cache each glyph (or actually its distance field representation) only once at a size of 64×64 pixels. The same texture is then used to render the glyph at any size by scaling it appropriately. In comparison, the native font rendering used by QPainter implies caching a separate version of the glyph for each size used in the application. This leads to a lower graphics memory consumption when using different sizes of the same font.</p>\n<p>To be able to scale freely the glyphs, we need to disable font hinting to have correct glyph positions at any level of zoom. As a consequence glyphs are also sub-pixel positioned (i.e. not pixel aligned).</p>\n<h1>Hack It Your Way</h1>\n<p>It you haven’t already, grab the <a href=\"https://qt.gitorious.org/qt/qt5\">Qt 5 repositories</a> and look for the files starting with <em>qsgdistancefield </em>in the QtDeclarative module.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For debugging purposes you can disable distance field text rendering with the QML_DISABLE_DISTANCEFIELD environment variable.</li>\n<li>On desktop platforms sub-pixel antialiasing is enabled by default, pass the <em>–text-gray-antialiasing </em>option to <em>qmlscene</em> to use the standard gray antialiasing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more reading on the topic have a look at this <a href=\"http://www.valvesoftware.com/publications/2007/SIGGRAPH2007_AlphaTestedMagnification.pdf\">paper from Valve</a>.</p>"

      "content" : "<p>\nI am mainly posting this to prevent any more people mailing me about\nthis release.  There's nothing really spectacular here.\n</p>\n<p>\nStarting from 2009 on, the usual suspects (aka OpenBSC developers) have\nbeen looking at various 3G femtocells, including the Vodafone one (I\nhave 10 of them here).  Aside from that Alcatel-Lucent design that\nVodafone uses, we've also looked at the Cisco/AT+T/ip.access design, as\nwell as the Ubiquisys/SFR one.  With some effort you can root all of\nthem, and you can then make sure they don't connect to the respective\noperator but to an IP address of your choosing.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe protocols are vendor-dependent.  The Vodafone femtocell uses a\nversion of RANAP (the protocol between RNC and MSC in UMTS) behind an 8\nbyte proprietary header.  As RANAP is specified in the 3GPP, it was\npretty easy to build a small piece of code that interacts with the unit.\n</p>\n<p>\nUbiquisys (used by SFR) uses the UMA protocols, and the\nCisco/ip.access/AT+T design uses a proprietary ip.access protocol called\nURSL (sort-of a \"progression\" of the 2G RSL to UMTS).\n</p>\n<p>\nSupporting them from OpenBSC is not easy.  While the call control and\nSMS transfer protocols of 3G are identical to GSM, everything below\ndoesn't really bear much resemblance.  I would guess it would take at\nleast a man-month to get basic signalling, call + SMS support working,\nif not more.\n</p>\n<p>\nGiven the fact that the femtocells all speak their vendor-proprietary\ndialects, and given that they often come with license terms that\nonly permit the use of their firmware in combination with their gateway\nlocated at the operator network, we never thought it is a high priority\nitem for us to work on.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhat you also have to consider, is that their output power of 20dBm is\neven less than the 200mW of typical small-scale GSM BTS, and that they\ntypically only support the operation of 4 concurrent phones.  Nothing\nthat you would be able to run e.g. a conference telephony network on.\n</p>\n<p>\nFurthermore, due to the wide channels (5MHz), it is very likely that all\navailable sprectrum has been auctioned off/licensed to commercial\noperators, so it's almost impossible to get something like a test\nlicense.  In GSM with 200kHz channels, there's often still a guard band\nor some unallocated channel that can be used.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf you really want to have some free software + femtocell based 3G\nnetwork, go ahead and do it.  The option existed for years now, ever\nsince femtocells started shipping to the market.  All of them are some\nform of embedded Linux systems.  Rooting them isn't really different\nfrom rooting a Linux based WiFi router / DSL modem.   So what's that\nnew about the THC release?  That a vendor of Linux embedded devices\nchose a trivial password?  If you're surprised by that, I guess you\nhaven't taken apart many embedded devices then.\n</p>"

      "content" : "<p>Seems like everybody’s writing Google+ reviews these days, but most of the ones I’ve found seem to be fluff pieces.  I haven’t used it long, but have some initial impressions to share.</p>\n<p>First, an analogy.  Facebook reminds me of the sleazy guy selling stuff from his car down the street.  They do things like change privacy defaults when they think it’s good for Facebook, rather than good for you.</p>\n<p>Google+ reminds me of an Apple product.  It’s beautiful, easy to learn, but locks everything down and is lacking some critical features.  So here goes with the details.</p>\n<p><b>The good</b></p>\n<p>I think that this can be best summed up by: <b>it’s not Facebook</b>.  Facebook has, perhaps, set an incredibly low bar but still, this holds.  Facebook is the only website I can ever remember using that changes things so much, so often, and so completely that I keep having this feeling of not knowing how to do things.  Try maintaining a Facebook page or two and you’ll especially feel my pain then.  But even the basics: how many times have I accidentally posted a partial comment because I pressed Enter to start a new paragraph (that has only been the button used for that for, hmm, let’s see now, <i>decades</i>), and instead it posted the comment.  Principle of least surprise, anyone?</p>\n<p>Google+ has a simple and, on the surface anyway, intuitive interface.  However, it does get muddy; more on that below.</p>\n<p>I’m going to spend a lot more space on “the bad” below, but don’t let that diminish my excitement about having a viable alternative to Facebook.  I am keen to get rid of that monster.</p>\n<p><b>The Bad</b></p>\n<p>I’ll start of this section with the fact that <b>Google+ is a tightly-controlled walled garden.</b>  There is no way to take a copy of your status updates, comments, etc. and back them up with your own devices.  If your Google account goes away, so do all your updates about your kids’ first words.  Facebook does have this feature these days.  It has broken half the time, but it exists, works, and I use it.  Twitter doesn’t have the feature built in, but its API makes it pretty easy; you could easily use my <a href=\"https://github.com/jgoerzen/twidge\">twidge</a> program to do this, for instance.</p>\n<p>But whatever you put in G+ stays in G+.  There is no autoposting it to twitter or Facebook, <del>no backups</del>, nothing.  I’m disappointed in that, given Google’s prior attitude about openness to individual data ownership.  (<b>Update 7/12/2011</b>: There is a way to get a backup, which I hadn’t noticed; see comments below.)</p>\n<p>Almost as bad, there’s also <b>no way to get data in</b>.  So I now have identi.ca, twitter, Facebook, and now also G+ accounts.  When I post an item in identi.ca, it autoposts to twitter, and then it autoposts from twitter to Facebook.  Handy – one place to notify people of my public activities.  My uploads to Flickr and blog posts also auto-post to Facebook, so people I’m friends with there get a picture of what I’m doing outside of Facebook without me manually having to link it in.</p>\n<p>Not so with G+.  There is no way to even add an RSS feed for my blog to auto-post to G+ as there is with Facebook.  If you use G+, the only way to get stuff into it is with a keyboard.</p>\n<p><b>Poor integration with other Google apps</b> is also an issue.  G+ is nowhere near Google’s first social app.  They also have Blogger, Google Reader, Buzz, Gmail, etc.  So here’s the rub.  These aren’t integrated well, and when they have tried to integrate them, they’ve done an exceedingly poor job of it.</p>\n<p>As an example: Buzz is a twitter-like service for posting updates.  Very similar to what G+ does, right?  Well, the best you can do is link your Buzz account to a separate tab on your profile.  You can’t even have your Buzz updates flow straight into G+, from what I can see.  You have a separate list of followers in Buzz from G+.  Reader is even worse; it has a sharing feature, but it’s not G+ aware, so it goes to a reader inbox.</p>\n<p>But what takes the cake is the integration with Gmail Contacts.  Sounds easy?  Not entirely.  When you add someone to G+, apparently it <i>sometimes</i> links the record with their entry in Contacts.  And the help gives you the handy warning that when you remove them from G+, you have the option of removing them from Contacts, which could impact what you see on a mobile device.  It is unclear what happens when it doesn’t link the record, or how it decides which record to link (some people have more than one person in a family sharing phone numbers and email addresses, for instance.)</p>\n<p>One very nice feature of G+ is you can add email addresses, even if they aren’t G+ members.  Then when you post updates to the circle you’ve added them to, G+ offers to send them an email with an update.  Very handy.</p>\n<p>Except the undocumented part is that if you select “Your circles” (meaning all your circles), rather than individually ticking the box by each circle, they don’t get the email.  And they also don’t get it if you set it Public.  You have to select their specific circle, which is a significant difference from how people with G+ accounts are treated.</p>\n<p>And that’s just an example.  There are a ton of things that work one way 95% of the time, but have non-obvious exceptions.  Some of these exceptions are documented in the help, and some aren’t.</p>\n<p>I’m still confused about the integration with Picasa.  G+ help says that you can upload unlimited numbers of photos for free (though they will be downscaled at a certain point).  Picasa has definite storage limits.  But G+ uploads are showing up in Picasa.  Do I really get free storage by uploading to the same place via a different tool?  Very odd.</p>\n<p>And finally, a gripe about web standards. I’ve been using Firefox/Iceweasel 3.5, which came out in Debian squeeze and is still supported there.  It is also pretty darn new by corporate IT standards.  And Google Plus refuses to let me log in with it, saying it’s “incompatible.”  Perhaps it can’t do some fancy animation, but then again I don’t really care.  Seems Google has forgotten the old RFC adage: be liberal in what you accept and conservative in what you generate.  If you can detect that my browser won’t animate something right, then you could give me a stripped-down version of the page rather than an error message.</p>"

      "content" : "As you've probably noticed at <a href=\"http://www.wxwidgets.org/\">www.wxwidgets.org</a>, the new 2.9.2 release was finally officially released this Tuesday. I won't detail its new features in details here as most important of them were already covered before but just wanted to say a few words about our future plans.<br><br>The next release -- incredibly enough -- will be 2.9.3 and we plan to do it at the end of September, after merging the work of GSoC 2011 students in the trunk. So ideally this release will have GTK+ 3 support, a new wxiOS port, wxWebViewCtrl for embedding a \"true\" HTML rendering engine (such as Trident under MSW or Webkit elsewhere) and a new UI animation library. Being realistic (although I'd certainly like to be proven wrong!), at least some of these things will probably be delayed but the release itself should still happen.<br><br>Depending on the things included in or omitted from 2.9.3 we may need to do 2.9.4 with all the big features we want in 3.0 next, although I'd like to avoid it and, again, ideally, 2.9.3 would already have all of them. If 2.9.3 does have everything and if no huge problems are discovered in it, we'd like to release 3.0 before the end of the year (meaning not later than mi-December). But then again, <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/logen-ninefingers\">you have to be realistic about these things</a>, so 3.0 will probably happen in the beginning of the next year rather than in this one. Still, planning it for 2011 at least gives us a target to miss.<br><br>As usual, let me end any roadmap discussion with a plea for help: we need your help. Most obviously with testing the huge amounts of the new code that will hopefully be in 2.9.3. But also with wxOS port as Stefan is almost alone working on it and with GTK+ 3 stuff as few people know it (yet). Please help us make 3.0 available sooner and, most importantly, better -- thanks in advance!"

      "content" : "There are a lot of possibilities for building wxWidgets under Windows using gcc. First of all, you can choose to use traditional makefile in <tt>build/msw/makefile.gcc</tt>. This binds you to using a <a href=\"http://www.mingw.org/\">MinGW</a> version of the compiler in Windows command prompt (i.e. <tt>cmd.exe</tt> as hopefully nobody uses systems with <tt>command.com</tt> any more) as the makefiles use DOS/Windows style paths and commands. Second, you can use the traditional Unix configure-and-make approach. Then you have a subchoice between using <a href=\"http://www.mingw.org/wiki/msys\">MSYS</a> which is a minimalistic environment developed by MinGW project or a full-blown <a href=\"http://www.cygwin.com/\">Cygwin</a> one. In the former case you would use MinGW compilers too, of course, and in the latter one the natural idea is to use Cygwin compilers. This however means that the generated programs would depend on Cygwin DLL and would require installing it for them to run. As this can be undesirable, there is also a possibility of using a MinGW cross-compiler from Cygwin environment which combines the advantages of being able to use Cygwin on the build machine while not requiring anything special for the deployment.<br><br>Let's summarize the choices in a concise list:<br><ol><li>Use makefiles: implies the use of MinGW compiler in DOS prompt.</li><li>Use configure+make; then choose between</li><ol><li>Using MSYS and MinGW compiler</li><li>Using Cygwin and Cygwin compiler</li><li>Using Cygwin and MinGW cross-compiler</li></ol></ol><br>The choice (1a) is probably the simplest one if you want to install as few things as possible. However, it doesn't allow you to easily specify many compilation options (you need to edit <tt>setup.h</tt> file instead of just passing options to configure on command line) and, worse, it doesn't produce a <tt>wx-config</tt> script as part of the build -- and even if it did, there would be no way to use it without some kind of Unix-like shell.<br><br>Because of this, I always recommended using the second approach to building wxWidgets. Moreover, personally I've always favoured using Cygwin because I use <a href=\"http://www.zsh.org/\">zsh</a> all day long anyhow. However traditionally you had to use Cygwin compiler which was the worst of the lot. Not only did it always lag a version or two (and sometimes more) behind the latest available MinGW one, but it also was significantly slower than MinGW version. And, of course, the binaries created by it depended on <tt>cygwin1.dll</tt>. Because of this, people fond of Cygwin (or, alternatively, not fond of many MSYS problems), also tried to use native MinGW compilers under Cygwin and this could be made to work but was so painful because you had to painstakingly ensure that both MinGW compiler and Cygwin tools could understand the paths you used (which basically meant that only relative paths could be really used as absolute paths take different forms for Windows-based MinGW compiler and Cygwin-based tools) that I could never wholeheartedly recommend it.<br><br>So I was very pleasantly surprised when I learnt that Cygwin now provides recent versions of MinGW cross-compiler or, rather, several of them. As Charles Wilson <a href=\"http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2011-06/msg00021.html\">explains here</a>, there is a cross-compiler for Win64 from <a href=\"http://mingw-w64.sourceforge.net/\">MinGW64</a> project, another cross-compiler for Win32 from the same project and also a Win32 cross-compiler from \"traditional\" <a href=\"http://mingw.org/\">MinGW</a>. Hence now you have yet another choice to make in case (2c).<br><br>Obviously, if you need to target Win64 the choice is easy to make, as there is only one of them. I recommend using MinGW64 version of Win32 cross-compiler as well for two reasons: first, it seems quite likely that you will need to target Win64 later even if you don't need it now, so why not use the same compiler that would allow you to build for Win64 later. And second, MinGW64 uses the so-called SJLJ exceptions which can propagate through the code not compiled with gcc, e.g. all Windows system DLLs. And in practice this is needed to be able to catch any exceptions thrown by your wxWidgets event handlers. So while DW2 exceptions used by MinGW version do have their advantages (in particular they are much more speed-efficient), SJLJ ones are preferable for wxWidgets GUI applications.<br><br>To summarize, my recommendation for building wxWidgets under Windows using gcc is now straightforward and unambiguous: use MinGW64 compiler under Cygwin. To be more precise, you need to install Cygwin (if you don't have it yet) and its <a href=\"http://cygwin.com/packages/mingw64-i686-gcc-g++/\">mingw64-i686-gcc-g++</a> package (you shouldn't download this file directly though, use Cygwin setup program to install it with all its dependencies). Then you simply need to run wxWidgets configure with the following options:<br><br><pre><br>$ /path/to/wx/configure --host=i686-w64-mingw32 --build=i686-pc-cygwin ...<br></pre><br><br>and run <tt>make</tt> as usual. You can also use <tt>wx-config</tt> script and, in general, things are almost as nice as under Unix. Just don't forget to use <tt>i686-w64-mingw32-g++</tt> compiler instead of plain <tt>g++</tt> if you write it manually instead of using <tt>`wx-config --cxx`</tt> output.<br><br>Another good news is that the speed of the compiler seems to have improved dramatically since the bad old gcc3 days: building the entire wxWidgets takes less than 4 minutes here with <tt>make -j8</tt> in default shared library build. Running configure itself is still painfully slow the first time but reasonably fast afterwards if you use <tt>-C</tt> option to cache the tests results.<br><br>Good luck building your applications using wxWidgets using Cygwin cross-compilers and thanks for Cygwin and MinGW(64) folks for making it faster and easier than ever!"

It is mostly a subset of modern OpenGL used on X86 desktop machines. From QEMU point of view this could mostly be ignored, as OpenGL was mostly used on games and specialist applications. This has now been changing, as desktops and user interfaces have started OpenGL to render graphics.

One of the first thing that you try to do with such a phone is to\nswitch to some alternate firmware (the coined term is “<span>ROM</span>”), like\n<a href=\"http://www.cyanogenmod.com/\">CyanogenMod</a>. Flashing a firmware is a whole new universe. You\nare told about a lot of proprietary tools, you need to download a lot\nof things from MegaUpload and friends and nobody really explains\nwhat’s going on under the hood. I was a bit lost at first.</p>\n<p>I will not provide a step-by-step guide since I cannot afford to stay\nup-to-date. Such a guide is usually posted on some forum. It assumes\nyou are running Windows and provides appropriate download links. You\n<strong>must</strong> follow it (and check that it is recent enough).

Most of them are specific to a\ngiven phone (or its close variations). They can be sorted in three categories:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Official firmwares</strong> from the phone manufacturer include a\n    kernel with appropriate drivers and, usually, a customized\n    interface (<span>HTC</span> Sense for <span>HTC</span>, TouchWiz for Samsung). Some\n    manufacturers will lag a lot behind Android schedule and you may\n    not get all the new shiny features.</li>\n<li><strong>Modified firmwares</strong> are built from the official firmwares. They\n    usually add a lot of hacks on top of the original firmware, remove\n    some cruft but are still closely related to the official firmware.</li>\n<li><strong>Firmwares built from <a href=\"http://source.android.com/\">Android Open Source Project</a></strong> (the\n    open source version of Android) do not share nothing with the\n    official firmware except some bits related to the kernel (drivers, hacks).</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Darky <span>ROM</span></h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.darkyrom.com/\">Darky <span>ROM</span></a> is a modified firmware. It takes the original\nfirmware from Samsung, adds a custom kernel (based on the source of\nthe official kernel), adds a lot of hacks, some additional\napplications and removes some unwanted cruft. This is a very nice\nfirmware which is quite snappy. This is a drop-in replacement for the\ndefault firmware: you will only get improvements.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.webcitation.org/5zj30aLRd\">latest version is 10.1</a> and there is a\n<a href=\"http://www.webcitation.org/5zj36IbDf\">neat guide on how to install it</a>.</p>\n<h2>CyanogenMod</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cyanogenmod.com/\">CyanogenMod</a> is a firmware built from <abbr title=\"Android Open Source Project\"><span>AOSP</span></abbr>. It supports several\ndevices and provide an unified firmware on all of them. Support for\nthe Samsung Galaxy S is recent and is not present in the stable\nbuild. However, <a href=\"http://download.cyanogenmod.com/?device=galaxysmtd\">some <span>RC</span> build is now available</a>. Be sure to\nread the <a href=\"http://forum.cyanogenmod.com/topic/24169-faq-cm7-on-the-samsung-galaxy-s/\"><span>FAQ</span></a> (most notably the part saying that you need to\ninstall from Froyo 2.2 because the bootloader provided by Samsung with\nGingerbread 2.3 is not compatible). You can also grab some information\n<a href=\"http://wiki.cyanogenmod.com/\">from the wiki</a>.</p>\n<p>The major drawback of using this firmware instead of going for a modified\nfirmware like Darky <span>ROM</span> is that the battery life may suck. I now need to\ncharge my phone every day instead of once every two days. On the plus\nside, you get a very clean firmware with a lot of features and almost no\ncruft. For example, the notification bar can be customized and OpenVPN\nis available out of the box.</p>\n<p>Moreover, almost everything is open source (if you don’t install\nGoogle apps). You can see this firmware as an open source distribution\nfor your phone. There is no need to download random files linked from\na random forum to make it work. There is no package manager,\nthough. Despite the bad battery life, I prefer this firmware.</p>\n<h1>Prerequisites</h1>\n<p>Before trying to flash a new firmware, there are some tools that you\nneed to have. Note that you don’t need root access to flash a new firmware.</p>\n<h2>Download <span>&amp;</span> recovery mode</h2>\n<p>Before trying to install any firmware, you must check that your phone\ncan access <strong>download</strong> and <strong>recovery</strong> modes. The download mode allows\nto flash any new firmware, even if the current firmware does not boot\nat all. As long as this mode is available, there is very little chance\nthat you brick your phone. To access those modes, you need to use the\n“three-button combo”. Here are the steps (your phone should not be plugged):</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Power off the phone (wait for the phone to vibrate).</li>\n<li>Hold the “Volume down” button for <em>download</em> mode. Hold the “Volume\n    up” button for <em>recovery</em> mode.</li>\n<li>Hold the “Home” button.</li>\n<li>Hold the “Power” button. The phone will start.</li>\n<li>Once you have the Samsung logo displayed on the screen, release\n    the “Power” button.</li>\n<li>Only release the two other buttons when you enter the recovery mode\n    or download mode. The recovery mode displays a menu. The download\n    mode displays a big yellow Android logo.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If after ten tries, you are unable to access those modes, maybe they\nhave been disabled. Keep reading, there is a solution.</p>\n<h2>Heimdall</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.glassechidna.com.au/products/heimdall/\">Heimdall</a> is a tool to flash a new firmware to your\nphone. This is not a mandatory tool but you will have to use it if\nsomething goes wrong. Most guides will tell you to use <em>Odin</em>. It is a\nleaked Samsung tool running on Windows only. You can use Heimdall instead.</p>\n<div><pre><span>$</span> git clone https://github.com/Benjamin-Dobell/Heimdall.git\n<span>Cloning into Heimdall...</span>\n<span>remote: Counting objects: 423, done.</span>\n<span>remote: Compressing objects: 100% (271/271), done.</span>\n<span>remote: Total 423 (delta 220), reused 332 (delta 138)</span>\n<span>Receiving objects: 100% (423/423), 5.91 MiB | 962 KiB/s, done.</span>\n<span>Resolving deltas: 100% (220/220), done.</span>\n<span>$</span> <span>cd </span>Heimdall/heimdall\n<span>$</span> sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0-0-dev\n<span>$</span> ./configure <span>&amp;&amp;</span> make\n<span>[...]</span>\n<span>$</span> sudo cp 60-heimdall-galaxy-s.rules /etc/udev/rules.d\n<span>$</span> sudo /etc/init.d/udev reload\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>You need to use this tool while in download mode. You can test it,\nwhile in download mode, with:</p>\n<div><pre><span>$</span> ./heimdall print-pit\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>This will display the partition table of your phone. This is\nenlightening to know what it contains:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>IBL+PBL</code> is the boot loader, be extra careful with it;</li>\n<li><code>PIT</code> is the partition table;</li>\n<li><code>EFS</code> contains some important data like <span>IEMEI</span>, be extra careful with it;</li>\n<li><code>SBL</code> is the second boot loader;</li>\n<li><code>SBL2</code> is the backup of the second boot loader;</li>\n<li><code>PARAM</code> contains some images used as various stage of the boot process;</li>\n<li><code>KERNEL</code> is the kernel;</li>\n<li><code>RECOVERY</code> is the backup of the kernel;</li>\n<li><code>FACTORYFS</code> contains <code>/system</code> file system which is some kind of\n   root file system;</li>\n<li><code>DBDATA</code> contains <code>/data</code> file system which is the database to\n   store application parameters;</li>\n<li><code>CACHE</code> contains <code>/cache</code> file system which contains the Dalvik cache;</li>\n<li><code>MODEM</code> contains the firmware for the modem.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As we will see, Heimdall is able to flash any of those partitions with\n<code>flash</code> subcommand.</p>\n<h2>adb</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/tools/adb.html\">adb</a> stands for Android Debug Bridge. Among other things, this\ntool allow you to drive your phone through the <span>USB</span> connection. You can\nget a shell, reboot into download or recovery mode, push files to your\nAndroid device, etc.</p>\n<p>To get this tool, you need to <a href=\"http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html\">download the full Android <span>SDK</span></a>.</p>\n<div><pre><span>$</span> tar zxvf ~/download/android-sdk_r11-linux_x86.tgz\n<span>$</span> <span>cd </span>android-sdk-linux_x86\n<span>$</span> tools/android update sdk\n<span>[select Android <span>SDK</span> Platform-tools]</span>\n<span>$</span> platform-tools/adb shell\n<span>#</span> uname -a\n<span>Linux localhost 2.6.35.7-<span>I9000XWJVH</span>-<span>CL184813</span> #Dark_Core_2.4 <span>PREEMPT</span> Mon May 16 15:02:38 <span>EEST</span> 2011 armv7l <span>GNU</span>/Linux</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>The important commands are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>shell</code> to get a shell on the device;</li>\n<li><code>reboot recovery</code> to reboot in recovery mode;</li>\n<li><code>reboot download</code> to reboot in download mode;</li>\n<li><code>push</code> to put a file on the phone;</li>\n<li><code>pull</code> to retrieve a file;</li>\n<li><code>install</code> to install an application from its <span>APK</span>;</li>\n<li><code>logcat</code> to see the logs and what happens, very useful!</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Restore download mode</h2>\n<p>If your phone is missing download mode, you can recover it with the\nhelp of <code>adb</code> and <code>heimdall</code>. You need to grab\nsome official firmware and extract <code>boot.bin</code> and\n<code>Sbl.bin</code> from it.</p>\n<div><pre><span>$</span> adb reboot download\n<span>$</span> heimdall flash --primary-boot ~/download/boot.bin --secondary-boot ~/download/Sbl.bin\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>Be extra careful here. You may brick your phone. Double check that you\ngrab the correct files and that they are really for your phone (there\nexists some variants). It worked for me.</p>\n<h1>Installing a new firmware</h1>\n<p>While you can switch from one firmware to another without losing your data,\nit is better to <em>wipe</em> your system and your data before switching\nfirmware. This means that you will lose all your applications and the data\ninside them (list of contacts, <span>SMS</span>, preferences). However, nothing\nwill ever modify your data in the internal <span>SD</span> card or in the external\n<span>SD</span> card (which are both inside the phone). They usually contains your\nmusic and your photos.</p>\n<p>There are two ways to install a firmware:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>via Heimdall, or</li>\n<li>using the recovery.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Heimdall</h2>\n<p>When a guide tells you to use Odin, you can use Heimdall instead. Odin\ntakes a <span>TAR</span> file. You should untar it and uses its content with\nHeimdall. For example:</p>\n<div><pre><span>$</span> ./heimdall flash --repartition --pit s1_odin_20100512.pit <span>\\</span>\n<span>&gt;</span>                  --factoryfs factoryfs.rfs <span>\\</span>\n<span>&gt;</span>                  --cache cache.rfs --dbdata dbdata.rfs <span>\\</span>\n<span>&gt;</span>                  --param param.lfs --modem modem.bin <span>\\</span>\n<span>&gt;</span>                  --kernel zImage --secondary-boot Sbl.bin \n<span>Claiming interface again...   Success</span>\n<span>Setting up interface...   Success</span>\n<span>Beginning session...</span>\n<span>Handshaking with Loke...   Success</span>\n\n<span>Uploading <span>PIT</span></span>\n<span><span>PIT</span> upload successful</span>\n<span>Uploading <span>SBL</span></span>\n<span>100%</span>\n<span><span>SBL</span> upload successful</span>\n<span>Uploading <span>KERNEL</span></span>\n<span>100%</span>\n<span><span>KERNEL</span> upload successful</span>\n<span>Uploading <span>MODEM</span></span>\n<span>100%</span>\n<span><span>MODEM</span> upload successful</span>\n<span>Uploading <span>PARAM</span></span>\n<span>100%</span>\n<span><span>PARAM</span> upload successful</span>\n<span>Uploading <span>FACTORYFS</span></span>\n<span>100%</span>\n<span><span>FACTORYFS</span> upload successful</span>\n<span>Uploading <span>DBDATAFS</span></span>\n<span>100%</span>\n<span><span>DBDATAFS</span> upload successful</span>\n<span>Uploading <span>CACHE</span></span>\n<span>100%</span>\n<span><span>CACHE</span> upload successful</span>\n<span>Ending session...</span>\n<span>Rebooting device...</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>You may be interested to update your modem using Heimdall. This is\nusually independent of the firmware you want to use. Also, no need to\nprovide a <span>PIT</span> file if you don’t want to repartition. Heimdall can read\nthe current one and flash only one of the partitions.</p>\n<h2>Recovery mode</h2>\n<p>The base recovery shipped with the Samsung Galaxy S does not have a\nlot of options. Moreover, it may be locked and will accept to install\nonly signed firmwares. Most firmwares come with <em>ClockWorkMod</em>, a more\nadvanced recovery. Once you get it, you will be able to use any <span>ZIP</span>\nfile to install a new firmware.</p>\n<p>My advice is to try to get <em>ClockWorkMod</em> as soon as possible. If you\nare root, you can install <a href=\"https://market.android.com/details?id=com.koushikdutta.rommanager\"><span>ROM</span> Manager</a> that will install\nit for you. If you are not root, most custom firmwares will provide\n<em>ClockWorkMod</em>. Therefore, you can just install a custom firmware with\nHeimdall. There exists special firmwares just for this, like\nEZbase. If you want to install CyanogenMod, be sure to download a\nFroyo firmware, not a Gingerbread one.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that the recovery is located inside the kernel. It is not\nself-contained in the bootloader (unlike download mode). If you don’t\nwant to flash a whole firmware (and lose everything on your phone)\njust to get the recovery, you can just flash the kernel.</p>\n<p>The <em>ClockWorkMod</em> recovery comes with an utility to backup your whole\nphone. This way, you can easily restore your previous firmware if you\ndon’t like the current one. This is what is called a <em>Nandroid</em> backup.</p>\n<h2>Lagfix</h2>\n<p>A lot of guides will tell you to enable or disable lagfix. Samsung\nshipped the Galaxy S with some crappy filesystem called <span>RFS</span> (which is\nsome kind of “enhanced” <span>FAT</span>). It is slow and seems responsible for\nsome lags that may happen on the interface. A <em>lagfix</em> is a way to\nreplace this filesystem by something better, like <span>EXT4</span> or <span>YAFFS2</span>. The\nprocess is pretty straighforward and consist to backup all the\npartition to the <span>SD</span> card, reformat it with another filesystem and\nrestore the backup.</p>\n<p>The lagfix may be applied automatically with some firmware (like\nCyanogenMod) or you may request it in the recovery mode (most modified\nfirmwares work this way). In this case, it will be applied\nautomatically on the next boot. You should disable it before\ninstalling another firmware with the recovery mode (no need if you\ninstall it with Heimdall).</p>\n<h1>Applications</h1>\n<p>You can find many free (as in free speech) applications for\nAndroid. Unfortunately, Android Market does not allow to use this\ncriteria as a filter. <a href=\"http://f-droid.org/repository/\">F-Droid</a> is an alternate market\nfeaturing only <abbr title=\"Free and Open Source Software\"><span>FOSS</span></abbr> applications.</p>\n<p>Here is a short selection of free applications:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://market.android.com/details?id=org.adw.launcher\"><span>ADW</span>.Launcher</a> is a home replacement app. It is very\n   configurable and themable.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/k9mail/\">K-9 Mail</a> is a very nice email client.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.xabber.com/\">Xabber</a> is a <span>XMPP</span>/Jabber client.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/connectbot/\">ConnectBot</a> is an <span>SSH</span> client (as well as a terminal).</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/droidwall/\">DroidWall</a> is an application firewall (using\n   Netfilter).

      "content" : "<p>Imagine you have to create a CAD-grade application, e.g. drawing the entire wireframe of a space shuttle or showing the intricacies of 9-layer printed circuit board. Basically something that involves a heavy work to display the result on the screen. On top of that, the application is still expected to perform smoothly in case the user wants to pan/scroll around and zoom in/out.</p>\n\n<p>The usual known trick to achieve this is by employing a <b>backing store</b>, i.e. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_buffer\">off-screen buffer</a> that serves as the target for the drawing operations. The user interface then takes the <a href=\"http://labs.qt.nokia.com/2007/08/09/qt-invaded-by-aliens-the-end-of-all-flicker/\">backing store</a> and displays it to the user. Now panning is a matter of translation and zooming is just scaling. The backing store can be updated asynchronously, thus making the user interaction decoupled from the complexity of the rendering. </p>\n\n<p>Moving to a higher ninja level, the backing store can be <b>tiled</b>. Instead of just one giant snapshot of the rendering output, it is broken down to small tiles, say 128x128 pixels. The nice thing is because each tile can be mapped as a <a href=\"http://www.opengl.org/resources/faq/technical/texture.htm\">texture</a> in the GPU, e.g. via glTexImage2D. <a href=\"http://www.gamedev.net/page/resources/_/reference/programming/opengl/269/opengl-texture-mapping-an-introduction-r947\">Drawing each textured tile</a> is also a (tasty) piece of cake, GL_QUAD with <a href=\"http://www.opengl.org/sdk/docs/man/xhtml/glBindTexture.xml\">glBindTexture</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Another common use-case for tiling is for online maps. You probably use it every day without realizing it in Google Maps, OpenStreetMap, or other similar services. In this case, the reason is to use tiles is mainly to ease the network aspect. Instead of sending a huge image representing the area seen by the user in the viewport, actually lots of small images are transported and stitched together by the client code in the web browser.</p>\n\n<p>Here is an illustration of the concept. The border of each tile is emphasized. The faded area is what you don't see (outside the viewport). Of course every time you pan and zoom, new fresh tiles are fetched so as to cover the viewport as much as possible.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-0ONkN3uPmiM/Tggb3aIIKjI/AAAAAAAAB9k/6UVPAoRNKes/s800/tiledmaps.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\"></p>\n\n<p>When I started to use the first generation iPhone years ago, I realized that the browser (or rather, its WebKit implementation) uses the very similar trick. Instead of drawing the web page straight to the screen, it uses a tiled backing store. Zooming (via pinching) becomes really cheap, it's a matter of scaling up and down. Flicking is the same case, translating textures does not bother any mobile GPU that much.</p>\n\n<p>Every iOS users know that if you manage to beat the browser and flick fast enough, it tries to catch up and fills the screen as fast as possible but every now and then you'll see some sort of <b>checkerboard pattern</b>. That is actually the <b>placeholder</b> for tiles which are not ready yet.</p>\n\n<p>Since all the geeks out there likely better understand the technique with a piece of code, I&#39;ll not waste more paragraphs and present you this week&#39;s X2 example: full-featured implementation of tiled backing store in &lt; 500 lines of Qt and C++. You can get the code from the usual <a href=\"https://github.com/ariya/X2\">X2 git repository</a>, look under <a href=\"https://github.com/ariya/X2/tree/master/graphics/backingstore\">graphics/backingstore</a>. When you compile and launch it, use mouse dragging to pan around and mouse wheel to zoom in/out. For the impatient, see the following 50-second screencast (or <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdLQl7d00Ak\">watch directly</a> on YouTube):</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For this particular trick, what you render actually does not matter much (it could be anything). To simplify the code, I do not use WebKit and instead just focus on SVG rendering, in particular of that famous <a href=\"http://ariya.github.com/svg/tiger.svg\">Tiger head</a>. The code should be pretty self-explanatory, especially for the TextureBuffer class, but here is some random note for your pleasure.</p>\n\n<p>At the beginning, every tile is invalid (=0). Every time the program needs to draw a tile, it checks first if the tile is valid or not. If yes, it substitutes it with the checkerboard pattern instead (also called the <i>default texture</i>) and triggers an <i>asynchronous update</i> process. During the update, the program looks for the most important tile which needs to be updated (usually the one closes to the viewport center). What is a tile update? It's the actual rendering of the SVG, clipped exactly to the rectangular bounding box represented by the tile, into a texture.</p>\n\n<p>To show the mix-n-match, I actually use Qt built-in <a href=\"http://labs.qt.nokia.com/2009/12/18/qt-graphics-and-performance-the-raster-engine/\">software rasterizer</a> to draw the SVG. That demonstrates that, even though each tile is essentially an OpenGL texture, you are not forced to use OpenGL to prepare the tile itself. This is essentially mixing <b>rasterization done by the CPU</b> with the <b>texture management handled by the GPU</b>.</p>\n\n<p>As I mentioned before, panning is a matter of adjusting the translation offset. Zooming is tricky, it involves scaling up (or down) the textures appropriately. At the same time, it also triggers an asynchronous refresh. The refresh function is nothing but to reset all the tiles to invalid again, which in turns would update each one by one. This gives the following effect (illustrated in the screenshot below). If suddenly you zoom in, you would see <b>pixelated</b> rendering (left). After a certain refresh delay, the tile update makes the rendering <b>crisp</b> again (right).</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-jD4rcrpqUu0/TgWBoEuAAKI/AAAAAAAAB9I/_t5KwA6Enhk/s800/gltiger_zoom.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"260\" alt=\"Zooming GLTiger\"></p>\n\n<p>Because we still need to have the outdated tiles scaled up/down (those pixelated ones), we have to keep them around for a while until the refresh process is completed. This is why there is another texture buffer called the <i>secondary background buffer</i>. Rest assured, when none of the tiles in the background buffer is needed anymore, the buffer is flushed.</p>\n\n<p>If you really want to follow the update and refresh, try to uncomment the debug compiler define. Beside showing the individual tiles better, that flag would also intentionally slows down both update and refresh so your eyes can have more time to trace them.</p>\n\n<p>BTW how would you determine the tile dimension in pixels? Unfortunately this can vary from one hardware to another. Ideally it's not too small because you'd enjoy the penalty of logical overdraw. If it's too large, you might not be progressive enough. Trial and error, that can be your enlightenment process.</p>\n\n<p>Being an example, this program has a lot of simplifications. First of all, usually you want the tile update to take place in a <b>separate thread</b>, and probably updating few tiles at once. With a proper thread affinity, this helps improving the overall perceptive smoothness. Also, in case you know upfront that it does not impact the performance that much, using <a href=\"http://gregs-blog.com/2008/01/17/opengl-texture-filter-parameters-explained/\">texture filtering</a> (instead of just GL_NEAREST) for the scaling would give a better zooming illusion.</p>\n\n<p>You might also see that I decided not to use the tile cache approach in the texture buffer. This is again done for simplicity. The continuous pruning of unused textures ensures that we actually don't grow the textures and kill the GPU. If you really insist on the absolutely minimal amount of overdraw and texture usage, then go for a slightly complicated cache system.</p>\n\n<p>Since I'm lazy, the example is using Open GL and quad drawing. If you want to run it on a mobile platform, you have patch it so that it works with Open GL ES. In all cases, converting it to use <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1116376/opengl-quad-rendering-optimization\">vertex and texture arrays</a> is likely a wise initial step. While you are there, hook the <a href=\"http://doc.qt.nokia.com/qtouchevent.html\">touch events</a> so you can also do the pinch-to-zoom effect.</p>\n\n<p>If you are brave enough, here is another nice final finish (as suggested by <a href=\"http://blog.thejit.org/\">Nicolas</a> of InfoVis and PhiloGL fame). When you zoom in, the tiles in the center are prioritized. However, when you zoom out, the tiles nearby the viewport border should get the first priority, in order to fill the viewport as fast as possible.</p>\n\n<p>Progressive rendering via a tiled backing store is the easiest way to take advantage of graphics processor. It's of course just one form, probably the simplest one, of hardware acceleration.</p><div><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/17722541-1085124302545683434?l=ariya.blogspot.com\" alt=\"\"></div>"

The external ones are used when hosts need\nInternet access. The internal ones are used when they want to\ncommunicate with each other. Because we don’t want hosts from the\nfirst site to communicate with hosts from the second site through the\nexternal network, we extend the internal network with the help of a\nsite-to-site IPsec <abbr title=\"Virtual Private Network\"><span>VPN</span></abbr>.</p>\n<p>Each set of networks is using two layer-3 networks on top of two\nlayer-2 networks. <abbr title=\"Open Shortest Path First\"><span>OSPF</span></abbr> is used to provide redundancy and\naggregation. For example, <code>R1</code> has two routes through <code>V1</code> to access\n<code>R2</code> which is on the other site:</p>\n<div><pre><span>#</span> ip route show 192.168.96.0/19\n<span>192.168.96.0/19  proto zebra  metric 10000 </span>\n<span>        nexthop via 192.168.1.100  dev eth0 weight 1</span>\n<span>        nexthop via 192.168.2.100  dev eth1 weight 1</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<h2>Setting up the lab</h2>\n<p>First, grab the source of the lab:</p>\n<div><pre><span>$</span> git clone https://vincentbernat@github.com/vincentbernat/network-lab.git\n<span>$</span> <span>cd </span>network-lab/lab-s2s-vpn\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>You may try to run <code>./setup</code> directly. It may be safer to build an\nimage of Debian inside inside a directory and use it as a base for the lab.</p>\n<div><pre><span>$</span> sudo debootstrap sid ../sid-chroot http://ftp.fr.debian.org/debian/\n<span>[...]</span>\n<span>$</span> sudo chroot ../sid-chroot /bin/bash\n<span>#</span> apt-get install iproute zsh rsyslog less makedev tcpdump\n<span>#</span> apt-get install bird quagga racoon\n<span>#</span> <span>exit</span>\n<span>$</span><span> </span><span><span>ROOT</span></span><span>=</span>../sid-chroot ./setup\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>You still need a working <abbr title=\"User Mode Linux\"><span>UML</span></abbr> kernel. On Ubuntu, the one provided in\n<code>user-mode-linux</code> does <a href=\"https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/user-mode-linux/+bug/801445\">not contain the <code>aufs.ko</code> module</a>. I\ndid not find a simple workaround. You can just grab the\n<a href=\"http://packages.debian.org/stable/user-mode-linux\">package from Debian</a> and install it on your Ubuntu with\n<code>dpkg -i</code>.</p>\n<h2>Use of <span>BIRD</span></h2>\n<p>With the <a href=\"http://vincent.bernat.im/en/blog/2011-uml-network-lab.html\">previous lab</a>, Quagga was used as an <abbr title=\"Open Shortest Path First\"><span>OSPF</span></abbr> routing\ndaemon. We still use it on <code>R1</code>, <code>R2</code>, <code>E1</code> and <code>E2</code>. However, Quagga\nis not able to run multiple instances of <abbr title=\"Open Shortest Path First\"><span>OSPF</span></abbr>. <a href=\"http://bird.network.cz/\"><span>BIRD</span></a>\ncan. Therefore, we use it on <code>V1</code> and <code>V2</code> because we need two <abbr title=\"Open Shortest Path First\"><span>OSPF</span></abbr>\ninstances: one for the external network and one for the internal\nnetwork. Since we also need <abbr title=\"Equal Cost Multipath\"><span>ECMP</span></abbr>, we need at least <span>BIRD</span> 1.3.0.</p>\n<p><span>BIRD</span> allows the definition of multiple routing tables. Those tables\nare independant of the kernel routing tables. Each protocol will\nmaintain its own set of routes and will allow to export (or import)\nroutes from one of the routing table maintained by <span>BIRD</span>. In our setup,\nwe use four protocols and only one routing table (the default one).</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://media.luffy.cx/images/vpn-lab-bird.png\" alt=\"BIRD routing tables\"></p>\n<p>The <code>ospf EXTERNAL</code> protocol is one of the two <abbr title=\"Open Shortest Path First\"><span>OSPF</span></abbr> instances we use on\n<code>V1</code>. We import all the routes learned through the <abbr title=\"Open Shortest Path First\"><span>OSPF</span></abbr> process into\nthe internal <span>BIRD</span> routing table. We don’t export any route from the\n<span>BIRD</span> routing table to this <abbr title=\"Open Shortest Path First\"><span>OSPF</span></abbr> instance. Here is the configuration of\nthis protocol:</p>\n<div><pre><span>protocol</span> <span>ospf</span> <span><span>EXTERNAL</span></span> <span>{</span>\n   <span>ecmp</span> <span>yes</span><span>;</span>\n   <span>import</span> <span>all</span><span>;</span>\n   <span>export</span> <span>none</span><span>;</span>\n   <span>area</span> <span>0.0.0.0</span> <span>{</span>\n      <span>networks</span> <span>{</span>\n         <span>203.0.113.0</span><span>/</span><span>26</span><span>;</span>\n         <span>203.0.113.64</span><span>/</span><span>26</span><span>;</span>\n         <span>203.0.113.150</span><span>/</span><span>32</span><span>;</span>\n      <span>};</span>\n      <span>interface</span> <span>\"eth2\"</span><span>;</span>\n      <span>interface</span> <span>\"eth3\"</span><span>;</span>\n      <span>interface</span> <span>\"lo\"</span> <span>{</span>\n        <span>stub</span> <span>yes</span><span>;</span>\n      <span>};</span>\n   <span>};</span>\n<span>}</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p><code>203.0.113.150/32</code> is defined on the loopback interface of <code>V1</code>. This\nis the <span>IP</span> of the local <abbr title=\"Virtual Private Network\"><span>VPN</span></abbr> endpoint.</p>\n<p>The <code>ospf INTERNAL</code> protocol is the second <abbr title=\"Open Shortest Path First\"><span>OSPF</span></abbr> instance. We import all\nroutes from this protocol to the <span>BIRD</span> routing table. We also want to\nadvertise the route to the remote site. This route is defined in the\n<code>static STATIC</code> protocol and imported into <span>BIRD</span> routing table.</p>\n<div><pre><span>protocol</span> <span>static</span> <span><span>STATIC</span></span> <span>{</span>\n   <span>import</span> <span>all</span><span>;</span>\n   <span>export</span> <span>none</span><span>;</span>\n   <span>route</span> <span>192.168.96.0</span><span>/</span><span>19</span> <span>via</span> <span>\"lo\"</span><span>;</span>\n<span>}</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>Therefore, <code>ospf INTERNAL</code> protocol export all routes originating from\nthe <code>static STATIC</code> protocol. This is done using filters:</p>\n<div><pre><span>protocol</span> <span>ospf</span> <span><span>INTERNAL</span></span> <span>{</span>\n   <span>ecmp</span> <span>yes</span><span>;</span>\n   <span>import</span> <span>all</span><span>;</span>\n   <span>export</span> <span>filter</span> <span>{</span>\n     <span>if</span> <span>proto</span> <span>=</span> <span>\"<span>STATIC</span>\"</span> <span>then</span> <span>accept</span><span>;</span>\n     <span>reject</span><span>;</span>\n   <span>};</span>\n   <span>area</span> <span>0.0.0.0</span> <span>{</span>\n      <span>networks</span> <span>{</span>\n         <span>192.168.1.0</span><span>/</span><span>24</span><span>;</span>\n         <span>192.168.2.0</span><span>/</span><span>24</span><span>;</span>\n      <span>};</span>\n      <span>interface</span> <span>\"eth0\"</span><span>;</span>\n      <span>interface</span> <span>\"eth1\"</span><span>;</span>\n   <span>};</span>\n<span>}</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>The <code>kernel</code> protocol is managing one kernel routing table. By\ndefault, it handles the <code>main</code> table. We don’t import any route from the\nkernel. However, we copy routes that come from other protocols, except\nthe static route because we already have a default route and the\nstatic route is some kind of blackhole, we don’t want to use it for\nreal routing.</p>\n<div><pre><span>protocol</span> <span>kernel</span> <span>{</span>\n   <span>persist</span><span>;</span>\n   <span>import</span> <span>none</span><span>;</span>\n   <span>export</span> <span>filter</span> <span>{</span>\n     <span>if</span> <span>proto</span> <span>=</span> <span>\"<span>EXTERNAL</span>\"</span> <span>then</span> <span>accept</span><span>;</span>\n     <span>if</span> <span>proto</span> <span>=</span> <span>\"<span>INTERNAL</span>\"</span> <span>then</span> <span>accept</span><span>;</span>\n     <span>reject</span><span>;</span>\n   <span>};</span>\n<span>}</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>The filtering mechanism built inside <span>BIRD</span> is pretty powerful.</p>\n<h2>Testing</h2>\n<p>After starting the lab, you need to wait a few seconds.

And it looks like everyone who chirped in is concerned with the speed, rather than nasty implementation details. I do suspect though that Linus meant something else than the syscall overhead, even if the magic mlock() takes care of the most obvious deadlocks. Maybe we should ask Al Viro if FUSE has any deep-seaing issues with directory renames or whatnot.</p>\n<p>Darcy, BTW, hasn't learned Linus' stealthy ways and falls for his \"I'm just a community manager anymore\" line. He <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Obdurodon/status/83711408243621888\">asked</a> \"since when has [Linus] understood anything about storage\" and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Obdurodon/status/84232661463351296\">called</a> Linus an \"ideologue\". But I remember well a couple of cases when best and brightest in kernel were stumped, until Linus gave up on waiting and fixed the problem. One such had something to do with some ptrace thing or other and it was a pretty bad firedrill. He demonstrated a sharp understanding of VM issues, too. I'm pretty sure that if Linus says so, there were issues with userland filesystems that their partisans gloss over or even fail to grasp altogether.</p>\n<p>Oh, and finally... I'm pretty sure that userland filesystems work just fine in network environments or when parallel access is arbitrated outside of VFS. I mean, just look at GoogleFS. Heck, you probably can implement a great Gluster node in userland of Windows or FreeBSD. Who cares what's in the black box?</p>\n<p>UPDATE: The \"<a href=\"http://blog.gluster.com/2011/06/linus-torvalds-doesnt-understand-user-space-storage/\">official response</a>\" from Anand Babu of Gluster is LOL: \"GlusterFS got its inspiration from the GNU Hurd kernel.\"</p>"

This couldn't be further from the truth.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn both the court hearings (in two independent cases), AVM has\nrepeatedly declined to make a clear statement that the modification and\ninstallation of modified version of the GPL-Licensed parts (like Linux)\nis acceptable to them.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe have raised this question in front of court and out of court, and\nAVM was not willing to make such a declaration.  If they had, I don't\nthink I would have had much reason to join the lawsuit on the side of\nthe defendant.\n</p>\n<p>\nI have no connection to Cybits (the defendant).  There has never been\nany business or other relationship to them, and they have not been\ninvolved in funding my legal expenses.  To be honest, I don't even care\nabout child filtering software in general, no matter from which vendor.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut I do care about the GPL, and the freedoms it grants.  The GPL is\nintended to allow <i>any third party</i> to modify, recompile,\nre-install and run modified versions of the respective GPL licensed\nprogram.  Any court order / verdict / judgement that tries to undermine\nthis freedom is a substantial danger to the Free Software movement - and\nas such I will do what I can to prevent it.\n</p>\n<p>\nAVM has stated in front of the court that <i>AVM releases the source\ncode compliant with the GPL, anyone can download, compile and use it -\njust not on OUR hardware</i>.  There you can clearly see their attitude:\nThey see the FritzBox as <i>their</i> hardware.  Last time I checked,\nthe unit is not rented by AVM, but is legally sold to the customer.  It\nis his decision to do with it what he wants.  Under the terms of the\nGPL, it is his decision to install whatever software on the hardware,\nincluding modified versions of the GPL licensed Linux kernel.\n</p>\n<p>\nJust imagine a world, where you buy a Laptop from HP, with Windows\npre-installed.  Now further imagine that there is a third-party software\nvendor (e.g. Canonical with its Ubuntu).  Now imagine that HP was suing\nCanonical for offering different software that runs on <i>their</i>\nhardware.   This is the kind of analogy that you need to think about.\n</p>\n<p>\nI don't think AVM is truly understanding the daemons they are calling\nhere.  If they actually manage to get a finally awarded judgement that\ndeprives third parties of their rights under the GPL, AVM will have\nviolated the GPL, specifically clause 6: <i>You may not impose any\nfurther restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted\nherein.</i>  And what would that mean?  That the GPLv2 is revoked and\nAVM looses the right to use the GPLv2 licensed software they use in the\nproduct.\n</p>"

I appear, physically and impossibly, in my own mental image.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://acertainrealism.blogspot.com/\">Francesco Pedraglio</a>, who I saw perform at the National Portrait Gallery last week, spoke of “non-experiential memories”. He meant things which had <em>not</em> happened, but of which we have memories nonetheless. He meant delusions. (In the same evening, Tom McCarthy said “Realism is a literary style with no more purchase on the real than Burroughs or Gysin”.) </p>\n<p>This digital memory sits somewhere between experience and non-experience; it is also an approximation; it is also a lie. These location records do not show where I was, but an approximation based on the device’s own idea of place, its own way of seeing. They cross-reference me with digital infrastructure, with cell towers and wireless networks, with points created by others in its database. Where I correlate location with physical landmarks, friends and personal experiences, the algorithms latch onto invisible, virtual spaces, and the extant memories of strangers.</p>\n<p>(Other aspects of the device’s place-making I enjoy: I love its hunger for new places, the inquisitive sensor blooming in new areas of the city, the way it stripes the streets of Sydney and Udaipur; new to me, new to the machine. It is opening its eyes and looking around, walking the streets beside me with the same surprise.)</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3286/5865642499_26516d5396_b.jpg\" width=\"700\" height=\"251\"></p>\n<p>Or how about this: In <em>The City &amp; The City</em>, China Miéville describes two cross-hatched urbanities, two cities occupying the same space and time, whose citizens have been acculturated from birth to see and unsee, their eyes settling on the streets, buildings and people of their own city, and sliding sightlessly over the structure and inhabitants of the other. To transgress this perceptual boundary is to both enact and provoke Breach—an illegal act, and also the name of the strange, supranatural entity that enforces the separation.</p>\n<p>We share the city, and increasingly the world, with another nature, invoked by us but long since split at the root, which looks at the same world with other eyes. The other city is the abstract machine: the digital networks, access points, substations and relay points, datacenters and fiber rings; its inhabitants are sensors and screens. Seeing through the machines’ eyes is a kind of breach: accessing a grosstoplogy of the network. (Timo Arnall breaches, oh so elegantly, <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/12187317\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/20412632\">here</a>.)</p>\n<p>This is an atlas, then, made by that other nature, seen through other eyes. But those eyes have been following <em>me</em>, unseen and without permission, and thus I consider provoking breach a necessary act.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5199/5865642555_14143c8d8c_b.jpg\" width=\"700\" height=\"233\"></p>\n<p>Perhaps how Kevin put it, in <a href=\"http://www.mobilemonday.nl/talks/kevin-slavin-reality-is-plenty-thanks/\">a recent talk</a>, reappropriated for the robots: “These are the astronauts for Earth, and they’re inventing new ways to see rather than things to look at. And rather than inventing new places to go, they’re inventing new ways to travel.”</p>\n<p>Or this: At the <a href=\"http://www.writerscentrenorwich.org.uk/worldsliteraturefestival.aspx\">Worlds literature festival</a> this week in Norwich, the Sri Lankan-Canadian writer Shyam Selvadurai spoke of the space between his identities represented by that hyphen. A place where “the tectonic plates of cultures rub against one another, producing the eruption of my work.” (I like that, that the challenge is not just to write at or about the interstices, but about what is forced up by the pressures between them.)</p>\n<p>Where Selvadurai is interested in the space between two human cultural identities, I suppose I am interested in the space where human and artificial cultures overlap. (“Artificial” is wrong; feels—what? Prejudiced? Colonial? Anthropocentric? Carboncentric?)</p>\n<p>There are no digital natives but the devices themselves; no digital immigrants but the devices too. They are a diaspora, tentatively reaching out into the world to understand it and themselves, and across the network to find and touch one another.

      "content" : "<img src=\"http://planet.debian.org/heads/zobel.png\" width=\"65\" height=\"85\" alt=\"\" align=\"right\" style=\"float:right\">  <div>I recently had been ask how persons usually not involved in Debian's development process can help Debian. This is a question that pops up quite often, so I thought I should write down a bit of that.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Help to make Debian a better OS</b></div><div>If you are using Debian, and you want something of your OS changed, open a bug report. This varies from wishlist bugs if you want to have an enhancement of a package over normal bugs for stuff that you think is a real bug up to serious or grave bug, if you found a security bug. Send a mail to submit@bugs.debian.org or use the tool <i>reportbug</i> and describe the problem you have found. Find more information <a href=\"http://www.debian.org/Bugs/Reporting\">here</a>. Be as verbose as possible when explaining your problem. This will make it easier for the package maintainer to help you and to understand the problem. If you are not sure which package to report the bug against, report it against <i>unknown</i>. The bug will be taken care of, there are guys redirecting those bug reports to the appropriate package!</div><div>You could also help to verify bug reports. There are dozens of packages around, that have hundred of open bug reports. It will help the Debian package maintainer if you can tell him a \"me too\", esp for complex problems, or if you found out how to reproduce a bug.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Help by spreading the word</b></div><div>If you are using Debian, speak about it! If you have problems with Debian, speak about it! If you like Debian, speak about it. Read the debian-user mailing list (or a localized one) and jump in if users have the same problem you had, and help them.</div><div>All sort of publicity will help Debian. If there is a small exhibition near to your living, speak there about Debian, and how you are using it. Speak also to Debian, we can help you to announce your presence at that exhibition and provide you with information material in various languages. Good contact point for that is <a href=\"mailto:events@debian.org\">events@debian.org</a>, or one of the debian-events-* mailing lists on <a href=\"http://lists.debian.org/\">lists.debian.org</a>. If you need help, ask for it. Also, you can help Debian manning an exhibition. If you see events in your area, offer to help and don't be shy.  Other way to help is working with the <a href=\"mailto:debian-publicity@lists.debian.org\">publicity team</a> and prepare press announcements, the <a href=\"http://wiki.debian.org/ProjectNews/\">Debian Project News</a> (DPN), contact journalists or press media if interesting things happen in Debian.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Help Debian to organize stuff</b></div><div>There are many ways to help Debian organize itself. For example the annual Debian Conference DebConf is a big organisation monster, and you don't need to be developer to help with that. Sometimes it's as easy as helping in the video team taping the conference, help at the front desk with registration, sorting badges or speaking to the caterer about needed foods. We also have miniDebConf or so called Debian Bug Squashing parties from time to time. Your company could provide office rooms, you could provide crash space for developers to sleep or even by sponsoring some beverages or food. Also helping around exhibition is a good idea. If your company is willing to print some flyers or posters this can help us.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Help by translating or writing documentation</b></div><div>Debian's website and all of the software Debian delivers should be available in all languages around the world! Good starting point for that is http://www.debian.org/international/ and the <a href=\"http://lists.debian.org/debian-i18n/\">Debian Internationalization Mailing list</a>. Also writing or extending documentation is a job everyone can do. If you are using a piece of software heavily and miss documentation, speak to the Debian package maintainer (you can find our at http://packages.debian.org/$yourpackage) and start submitting bugs with documentation.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Help by donating</b></div><div>There are actually many ways to help by donating (not only by money). Surely Debian will accept money donations via one of it's official representation (<a href=\"http://www.ffis.de/\">ffis</a>, <a href=\"http://www.spi-inc.org/\">SPI</a>, <a href=\"http://www.debian.ch/\">debian.ch</a>, ...). On the other hand donating can be as simple as allowing your employees to work some specified time on the week on Debian! Or you donate machine hardware (probably not your old ones that you used five years and which are not under warranty now any more, sorry...), bandwith or colocation in your datacenter. Speak to the <a href=\"mailto:hardware-donation@debian.org\">hardware donations team</a> if you want to know the current needs.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Conclusion</b></div><div>I only wrote down a very few areas where you can help Debian, and there are plenty more! Don't hesitate to jump in to help. If you don't understand stuff: ask! But be prepared that you will be pointed to URLs where the stuff you ask for is documented. Helping Debian sometimes starts with reading tons of documentation (and i am sure you will find errors in that documentation to fix!), but after a while it makes a lot of fun to work for and with Debian. Find your own area to work on within Debian, and don't think you can't help. Even graphic designers, lawyers or clerks can help Debian!</div><div><br></div><div>I started using Debian around 15 years ago and became Debian Developer around 6 years ago. Within the last six years I had been in various positions inside Debian (listmaster team member, volatile team member, release team member and Stable Release Manager, Debian Sysadmin Team member) and got to those just by jumping in where help needed.</div><div><br></div> <img src=\"http://analytics.ftbfs.de/piwik.php?idsite=1&amp;rec=1&amp;action_name=How+YOU+can+help+Debian!+-+zobel%27s+blog\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:0\"><div><br></div>"

AVM does not own the copyright to that GPL-licensed\nsoftware.  How can they seek to prevent anyone from exercising their\nright to modify the code and run modified versions of it?  This is one\nof the most fundamental freedoms that Free Software grants its users.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the last lawsuits (preliminary proceedings) that AVM has brought\nabout, I have intervened on behalf of Cybits.  At that time, the court\nwas impressed and has restricted a previously-granted preliminary\ninjunction against Cybits to not include any claims regarding the Free\nSoftware portions of the product.\n</p>\n<p></p>\nBut meanwhile, AVM has filed for the main/regular proceedings.  Tomorrow\n(June 21st, 11am), there will be the first hearing at the district\ncourt (Landgericht Berlin, Room 2709, Littenstr. 12-17, Berlin).\n<p></p>\n<p>\nI have applied to be a side intervener in those main proceedings, too.\nGiven that the previous court accepted this, I assume it will be\naccepted in the district court, too.\n</p>\n<p>\nNormally I wouldn't care much if two companies are taking it to court.\nBut this case is not about Cybits or AVM.  This case is about the\nfundamental question of whether a device maker using Linux and other GPL\nlicensed software has the right to use legal means to prevent third\nparties from exercising their fundamental rights granted under the GPL.\n</p>\n<p>\nFor more information about the case and background information, please\ncheck out <a href=\"http://fsfe.org/projects/ftf/avm-gpl-violation.en.html\">this background page at FSFE</a>.\n</p>"

Not listening to such comments as ”the chip will never be used anywhere else” and ”why not spend your time doing something more relevant”, he has chosen to actually do what he likes and sees as an interesting challenge. And that's often the spirit of free software, so I don't really agree with the naysayers.<br><br>The camera shot on the right, running KMS-enabled X.org driver for the glamo chip on my Debian installation (visible software matchbox-window-manager, fbpanel, zhone), is a bit optimistic looking since Zhone happens to draw correctly. A lot of the drawing is not yet synced correctly, which shows as all text and images in eg. GTK applications being garbled. But as little as two days ago one couldn't yet much launch applications without X crashing, so the newest commits by Thomas were a big step forwards. I'm using <a href=\"http://wiki.debian.org/DebianOnFreeRunner\">Debian</a>, and he's not, so I try to find time to help in debugging even though I really can't much help with the driver code.<br><br>The driver is not just one piece of code, but consists of a <a href=\"http://git.openmoko.org/?p=kernel.git;a=shortlog;h=refs/heads/drm-tracking\">kernel drm driver</a> (direct rendering manager) using <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_Execution_Manager\">GEM</a>, <a href=\"http://git.bitwiz.org.uk/?p=libdrm.git;a=shortlog;h=refs/heads/glamo\">libdrm support</a> for the kernel driver and finally <a href=\"http://git.openmoko.org/?p=xf86-video-glamo.git;a=shortlog;h=refs/heads/kms\">the X.org driver</a> supporting these other components and offering buzz-words like DRI2. There is also a beginning of a <a href=\"http://git.bitwiz.org.uk/?p=mesa.git;a=shortlog;h=refs/heads/glamo\">Mesa 3D driver</a>, though it is so far just a skeleton driver since the 2D/KMS/EXA/DRM parts are what should be done first before dwelling into the OpenGL realm.<br><br>Openmoko the company is basically nowadays just producing new Neo FreeRunners to resellers, but the community of the so far only Free phone is thriving. The final (Openmoko produced, from where <a href=\"http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Gta02-core\">gta02-core</a> continues) version of the phone, with the famous buzzing problem fixed, appeared on store shelves some time ago, offering better out-of-the-box phone functionality in addition to all the ”mini computer” features. It was also <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bivsHpqQDso\">offered</a> to <a href=\"http://www.debconf.org/\">Debconf</a> visitors on <a href=\"http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2009/05/msg00003.html\">discount</a>.<br><br>It's not only cool to have kernel mode-setting, though it is indeed very cool as well. The reason for much sorrow in the whole OM project has been the graphics chip, and some of the problems with the chip are only finally solvable with the kernel doing the mode-setting. So it's both a very modern thing to use KMS, but there are also clear potential benefits of having accurate control over this very ”sensitive” piece of silicon. The current non-KMS X.org driver for example busy loops in order to try to feed the chip at a correct pace, causing CPU usage every time there is any drawing going on.<br><br>This is somehow reminding me about getting the best out of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum\">8-bit computers</a> and other hardware with some specific limitations. The glamo chip is very limited in some ways, but also capable in some other ways like theoretically offering MPEG-4 decoding, OpenGL ES 3D support. It's a mixed bag of things, and I can very well imagine it's indeed an interesting challenge to work on it, if you just have the skills (I don't) and nerves (proper debugging tools help).<br><br>It's so nerdy to drool over lines in the X.org log, but I just can help it:<br><blockquote>X.Org X Server 1.6.3<br>Release Date: 2009-7-31<br>X Protocol Version 11, Revision 0<br>Build Operating System: Linux 2.6.28 armv5tel Debian<br>Current Operating System: Linux neo 2.6.29-GTA02_mydrm #2 PREEMPT Mon Aug 17 18:24:39 EEST 2009 armv4tl<br>...<br>II) Using KMS!<br>...<br>(WW) Glamo(0): EXA hardware acceleration initialising<br>(II) EXA(0): Driver allocated offscreen pixmaps<br>(II) EXA(0): Driver registered support for the following operations:<br>(II)         Solid<br>(II)         Copy<br>(II) Glamo(0): Initialized EXA acceleration<br>...<br>(II) Glamo(0): RandR 1.2 enabled, ignore the following RandR disabled message.<br>...<br>(II) Glamo(0): [glamo-dri] Name of DRM device is '/dev/dri/card0'<br>(WW) Glamo(0): [DRI2] Version 1 API (broken front buffer rendering)<br>(II) Glamo(0): [DRI2] Setup complete<br>...<br>(II) AIGLX: enabled GLX_MESA_copy_sub_buffer<br>(II) AIGLX: Loaded and initialized /usr/lib/dri/glamo_dri.so<br>(II) GLX: Initialized DRI2 GL provider for screen 0<br>(II) Glamo(0): Adding framebuffer....!<br>(II) Glamo(0): 8 480 640 16 16 960<br>(II) Glamo(0): rootPixmap = 0x1d0a00<br>(II) Glamo(0): Done<br><br></blockquote><div><img src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/31939153-923926235576514540?l=losca.blogspot.com\" alt=\"\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"></div>"

I pretty much did everything like he suggests except I used the \"<a href=\"http://zaitcev.livejournal.com/207667.html\">Rich Jones</a>\" prefix <b>fd2d:acfb:74cc::/48</b> instead of Dan's 2000:dead:beef::/48. One thing that bothers me with all this is the need to have statics at the upstream router and the ICMP redirects. It would be totally kickass if Dan came up with some kind of \"standard\" Zebra config or found some other way to make it all automatic. The sticking point is that in case of OSPF you still need to configure the upstream router, and in a non-obvious way, too. Static routes are well understood. Back in the 90s, we just ran routed everywhere, which required zero administration, but that's not IPv6 compatible.</p>\n<p>Honestly, the more I look at challenges that virtual hosts introduce, the more I think that bridged networking should be the default in libvirt. The only reason I personally do not do it is that historically Linux bridging was a mess full of bugs, plus it changed in incompatible ways every 7 to 10 kernel releases. This may be not the case anymore, but I am too set in my ways.</p>"

Back when Lennart wrote his blog articles, he even included running rsyslog into examples of socket activation. But some time around April 2011, systemd subsumed yet another function. Whoever instigated the takeover of logging thought it would be fun to stop updating /var/log/messages altogether and instead pollute the dmesg with usermode messages. He also neglected to document this in any way. If Lennart (or his overly smart disciple) were made to compensate frustrated sysadmins for hours spent banging their heads on desks, he might have thought otherwise. But the beauty of the scheme is that the companies employing said sysadmins get to pay... In fact, Lennart even <a href=\"http://0pointer.de/blog/projects/why.html\">listed</a> \"availability of specialized consulting\" for systemd as a plus. He is my hero, really. If I were 1/10 as evil as that man, my life would've been an amazing success.</p>\n<p>Aside from the training costs, there's also an insignificant resource cost. My side by side comparisons show RSS jumping from 1.3MB to 22MB (on top of total mapped size going from 19MB to 54MB). Basically nothing to talk about. I was never hit by the \"systemd ate my CPU\" syndrome.</p>\n<p>UPDATE: <a href=\"http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/systemd-devel/2011-January/001163.html\">A message</a> by Kay suggests that rsyslog needs to be run. It simply was not configured right in F16 Rawhide, a small bug somewhere. Just needs \"systemctl enable rsyslog.service\". A day was wasted, however.</p>\n<p>UPDATE M0AR: Andrey's message already has all the info, but I'm going to restate how systemd actually improves upon what we had previously. The confusing part is that systemd does not merely do socket activation for syslog, but acts as a syslogd. Once rsyslogd starts, it takes over. The dmesg then is saved in the usual way. This way, syslog service is available before rsyslogd is up, e.g. for initrd time. Why is this not documented? My guess is, as long as everything works smoothly, it is a transparent improvement, so needs no explanation.</p>"

      "content" : "<img src=\"http://planet.debian.org/heads/bernat.png\" width=\"67\" height=\"82\" alt=\"\" align=\"right\" style=\"float:right\">  <p>In a recently published article, Paul Vixie, past author and\narchitect of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIND\"><abbr title=\"Berkeley Internet Name Daemon\"><abbr title=\"Berkeley Internet Name Daemon\"><span>BIND</span></abbr></abbr></a>, one of the most popular internet domain\nserver, <a href=\"http://www.circleid.com/posts/20110531_anycast_unicast_or_both/\">explains why <span>DNS</span> servers should use anycast</a> for\nincreased reliability and faster answers. The main argument against\nunicast is that some resolvers may not be smart enough to select the\nbest server to query and therefore, they may select a server on the\nother side of the planet. Since, you cannot go faster than light,\nyou get a penalty of about 100 milliseconds in this case.</p>\n<h1>Unicast <span>&amp;</span> anycast</h1>\n<p>Most addresses that you handle are <em>unicast</em> addresses, i.e. the\naddress of a single receiver. Any time you send a packet to an\nunicast address, it will be forwarded to this single receiver. Another\ncommon network addressing system is <em>multicast</em> (which happens to\ninclude <em>broadcast</em>). When you send a packet to a multicast address,\nseveral receivers may get it. The packet is copied as needed by some nodes.</p>\n<p><em>Anycast</em> addresses allow you to send a packet to a set of receivers\nbut only one of them will receive it. The packet will not be\ncopied. Usually, the idea behind anycast is that the packet is sent\nto the nearest receiver.</p>\n<p>There is no universal way to determine if an <span>IP</span> address is an unicast address or\nan anycast address just by looking at it. For example <code>192.5.5.241</code> is\nan anycast address while <code>78.47.78.132</code> is an unicast address.</p>\n<p><abbr title=\"Internet Systems Consortium\"><span>ISC</span></abbr>, which maintains <abbr title=\"Berkeley Internet Name Daemon\"><span>BIND</span></abbr>, operates the “F” root domain server, one of\nthe 13 Internet <a href=\"http://www.root-servers.org/\">root name servers</a>. This server is\nqueried by using <code>192.5.5.241</code> IPv4 anycast address or\n<code>2001:500:2f::f</code> IPv6 anycast address. <abbr title=\"Internet Systems Consortium\"><span>ISC</span></abbr> has published a\n<a href=\"http://ftp.isc.org/isc/pubs/tn/isc-tn-2003-1.txt\">document explaining how anycast works</a>. Several nodes around\nthe globe announces the same subnet using <abbr title=\"Border Gateway Protocol\"><span>BGP</span></abbr>. When one router running\n<abbr title=\"Border Gateway Protocol\"><span>BGP</span></abbr> has to send a query to the anycast address, it will have several\nchoices in its <abbr title=\"Border Gateway Protocol\"><span>BGP</span></abbr> table. It will usually select the shortest path and\nroute the query to the corresponding router.</p>\n<p>Some nodes may choose to restrict the announcement about the subnet\ncontaining the anycast address. They are called local nodes (by\nopposition to other global nodes). This allows them to serve query\nonly from their clients and use cheaper connectivity and hardware.</p>\n<h1>Lab</h1>\n<p>Let’s play with anycast by setting up a lab to experiment with it. We\nwant to setup an IPv6 anycast <span>DNS</span> service using two global nodes, <code>G1</code>\nand <code>G2</code>, and one local node, <code>L1</code>. We build some kind of\nmini-Internet. See :</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://media.luffy.cx/images/anycast-lab.png\" alt=\"Anycast lab\"></p>\n<h2>Setting up the lab</h2>\n<p>This lab will use <abbr title=\"User Mode Linux\"><span>UML</span></abbr> guests for all nodes. For more details on how\nthis works, look at my\n<a href=\"http://www.luffy.cx/en/blog/2011-uml-network-lab.html\">previous article about network labs with User Mode Linux</a>. You\nfirst need to grab the lab:</p>\n<div><pre><span>$</span> git clone https://vincentbernat@github.com/vincentbernat/network-lab.git\n<span>$</span> <span>cd </span>network-lab/lab-anycast-dns\n<span>$</span> ./setup\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>You will need to install the dependencies needed by the script on your\nhost system. The script was tested on Debian unstable. If some of the\ndependencies do not exist in your distribution, if they don’t behave\nas in Debian or if you don’t want to install them on your host system,\nyou can use <code>debootstrap</code> to create a working system:</p>\n<div><pre><span>$</span> sudo debootstrap sid ./sid-chroot http://ftp.debian.org/debian/\n<span>[...]</span>\n<span>$</span> sudo chroot ./sid-chroot /bin/bash\n<span>#</span> apt-get install iproute zsh aufs-tools\n<span>[...]</span>\n<span>#</span> apt-get install bird6\n<span>[...]</span>\n<span>#</span> <span>exit</span>\n<span>$</span><span> </span>sudo mkdir -p ./sid-chroot/<span>$<span>HOME</span></span>\n<span>$</span> sudo chown <span>$(</span>whoami<span>)</span> ./sid-chroot/<span>$<span>HOME</span></span>\n<span>$</span> <span><span>ROOT</span></span><span>=</span>./sid-chroot ./setup\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>We are running a lot of <abbr title=\"User Mode Linux\"><span>UML</span></abbr> guests in this lab. We assign 64 <span>MB</span> to\neach host. <abbr title=\"User Mode Linux\"><span>UML</span></abbr> guests do not use host memory until they need it but\nbecause of cache subsystem, you can expect that each guest will use 64\n<span>MB</span> of memory. This means that you need about 2 <span>GB</span> of <span>RAM</span> to run this\nlab. Moreover, each guest will create a file representing its\nmemory. Therefore, you need about 2 <span>GB</span> of free space in <code>/tmp</code> too.</p>\n<p>Routers are named after their <abbr title=\"Autonomous System\"><span>AS</span></abbr> number. The router of <abbr title=\"Autonomous System\"><span>AS</span></abbr> 64652 is\njust <code>64652</code>. <code>Paris</code>, <code>NewYork</code> and <code>Tokyo</code> are the exception.</p>\n<p>The lab will use only one switch but we will use <span>VLAN</span> to create\nseveral L2 networks. Each link in our schema is an L2 network. Each\nlink will get its own L3 network. Those networks are prefixed with\n<code>2001:db8:ffff:</code>. Leaf <abbr title=\"Autonomous System\"><span>AS</span></abbr> have their own L3 network <code>2001:db8:X::/48</code>\nwhere <code>X</code> is the <abbr title=\"Autonomous System\"><span>AS</span></abbr> number minus 60000. Look at <code>/etc/hosts</code> on each\nhost to get the <span>IP</span> of all hosts.</p>\n<h2>Mini-Internet routing</h2>\n<p><abbr title=\"Autonomous System\"><span>AS</span></abbr> 64600 is some kind of Tier-1 transit network (like\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_3_Communications\">Level 3 Communications</a>). It has three points of presence:\nParis, New York and Tokyo. <abbr title=\"Autonomous System\"><span>AS</span></abbr> 64650 is an European regional transit\nnetwork, <abbr title=\"Autonomous System\"><span>AS</span></abbr> 64640 is an East Asian regional transit network and <abbr title=\"Autonomous System\"><span>AS</span></abbr>\n64610, 64620 and 64630 are North American regional transit network which are\npeering each other. Other leaf <abbr title=\"Autonomous System\"><span>AS</span></abbr> are local <span>ISP</span>.</p>\n<p>This is not really what Internet looks like but shaping our lab like a\ntree allows us to not deal with a lot of <abbr title=\"Border Gateway Protocol\"><span>BGP</span></abbr> stuff: we ensure that the\nshortest path (in number of <abbr title=\"Border Gateway Protocol\"><span>BGP</span></abbr> hops) from one client to one server is\nthe best path. Each <abbr title=\"Border Gateway Protocol\"><span>BGP</span></abbr> router will get a basic <abbr title=\"Border Gateway Protocol\"><span>BGP</span></abbr> configuration\ncontaining only the list of peers. Since <code>Paris</code>, <code>Tokyo</code> and\n<code>NewYork</code> are in the same <abbr title=\"Autonomous System\"><span>AS</span></abbr>, they will use iBGP. They are fully\nmeshed for this purpose but this does not provide redundancy because\niBGP routes are not redistributed inside iBGP. A more complex setup\nwould be needed to provide redundancy inside <abbr title=\"Autonomous System\"><span>AS</span></abbr> 64600. We don’t use an\n<abbr title=\"Interior Gateway Protocol\"><span>IGP</span></abbr> inside leaf <abbr title=\"Autonomous System\"><span>AS</span></abbr> as we should: for the sake of simplicity, we\nredistribute directly connected routes into <abbr title=\"Border Gateway Protocol\"><span>BGP</span></abbr>.</p>\n<p>While in my <a href=\"http://www.luffy.cx/en/blog/2011-uml-network-lab.html\">previous lab</a>, I used Quagga, I will use\n<a href=\"http://bird.network.cz/\"><span>BIRD</span></a> in this one. It is a more modern daemon with a clean\ndesign on how routing tables may interact. It also performs\nbetter. However, it lacks several features from Quagga.

However, we hit here some limitations of <span>BIRD</span>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>The correct way to let <code>64622</code> knows about this route is to build\n  a <abbr title=\"Border Gateway Protocol\"><span>BGP</span></abbr> confederation for <abbr title=\"Autonomous System\"><span>AS</span></abbr> 64620 and let <abbr title=\"Autonomous System\"><span>AS</span></abbr> 64622 and <abbr title=\"Autonomous System\"><span>AS</span></abbr> 64621 be\n  part of it. This means that those three <abbr title=\"Autonomous System\"><span>AS</span></abbr> will be seen as <abbr title=\"Autonomous System\"><span>AS</span></abbr> 64200\n  from outside of the confederation. Moreover, the <code>no-export</code>\n  community would allow to export the route only within the\n  confederation. This is exactly what we need but <span>BIRD</span> does not\n  support confederations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>BIRD</span> first selects the best route to export then apply\n  filtering. This means that even if <code>64620</code> knows non-filtered route\n  to <code>2001:db8:aaaa::/48</code>, it will select the route to <code>L1</code>, filter it\n  out and export nothing to <code>64622</code>.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Therefore, we need to fallback to ask <span>BIRD</span> to <em>not</em> export the route to\n<abbr title=\"Autonomous System\"><span>AS</span></abbr> 64600, 64610 and 64630 on <code>64620</code>. We could use a special community\nto filter out the route but we keep it simple and just filter the\nroute directly.</p>\n<div><pre><span>filter</span> <span>keep_local_dns</span> <span>{</span>\n   <span>if</span> <span>net</span> <span>~</span> <span>[</span> <span>2001</span><span>:</span><span>db8:aaaa::</span><span>/</span><span>48</span> <span>]</span> <span>then</span> <span>reject</span><span>;</span>\n   <span>accept</span><span>;</span>\n<span>}</span>\n<span>protocol</span> <span>bgp</span> <span>{</span>\n   <span>description</span> <span>\"<span>BGP</span> with peer NewYork\"</span><span>;</span>\n   <span>local</span> <span>as</span> <span>64620</span><span>;</span>\n   <span>neighbor</span> <span>2001</span><span>:</span><span>db8:ffff:4600:4620::1</span> <span>as</span> <span>64600</span><span>;</span>\n   <span>gateway</span> <span>direct</span><span>;</span>\n   <span>hold</span> <span>time</span> <span>30</span><span>;</span>\n   <span>export</span> <span>filter</span> <span>keep_local_dns</span><span>;</span>\n   <span>import</span> <span>all</span><span>;</span>\n<span>}</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>Voilà. Only <code>C4</code> will be able to query <code>L1</code>. If <abbr title=\"Autonomous System\"><span>AS</span></abbr> 64621 is missing,\nit will query <code>G2</code> instead. One major point about anycast is to know\nthat redundancy is done at the <abbr title=\"Autonomous System\"><span>AS</span></abbr> level only. If the name server on\n<code>L1</code> does not work correctly, requests will still be routed to\nit. Therefore, with anycast, you still need to provide redundancy\ninside each <abbr title=\"Autonomous System\"><span>AS</span></abbr> (or stop advertising the anycast network as soon as\nthere is a failure).</p>\n<h1>Beyond <span>DNS</span></h1>\n<p>Anycast can be used to serve <span>HTTP</span> requests too. This is less commonly\nused because your connection may be rerouted to another node while it\nis still running. This is not a problem with <span>DNS</span> because there is no\nconnection (you send a query, you receive an answer). There are at\nleast two <abbr title=\"Content Delivery Network\"><span>CDN</span></abbr> (<a href=\"http://www.maxcdn.com/\">MaxCDN</a> and <a href=\"http://www.cachefly.com/\">CacheFly</a>) which uses\nanycast to ensure low roundtrip time and very high reliability.</p>\n<p>Setting up an <span>HTTP</span> server with an anycast address is no different than\nsetting up a <span>DNS</span> server. However, you need to ensure maximum stability\nof the routing path to avoid the connection to be dropped while\nrunning. I suppose that this is done by hiring some high-level <abbr title=\"Border Gateway Protocol\"><span>BGP</span></abbr>\nexpert. You can also mix unicast and anycast:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>anycast <span>DNS</span> answers the <span>IP</span> address of a nearby unicast <span>HTTP</span> server, or</li>\n<li>anycast <span>DNS</span> answers the <span>IP</span> address of an anycast <span>HTTP</span> server that\n   will issue a redirect to an unicast <span>HTTP</span> server when downloading or\n   streaming large files.</li>\n</ul>"

Now I've figured out a way to get it working on amd64 with\nthe free radeon drivers (Gallium versions).</p>\n<p>It's actually pretty simple, as most things are, once you figured it out. For\n64 bit applications, you just need a recent Mesa version and the <a href=\"http://debian-multimedia.org/pool/main/libt/libtxc-dxtn/libtxc-dxtn.php\" title=\"debian-multimedia.org: libtxc-dxtn0\">package <tt>libtxc-dxtn0</tt></a>.\nIf you're using a card supported by the r600g driver, you first need a version\nof the Mesa package, which is build with the Gallium version of the r600 driver\n(the classic driver should work too, but I haven't tested that), like <a href=\"http://dev.carbon-project.org/debian/mesa/\" title=\"Unofficial Mesa packages for r600g testing\">my unofficial Mesa\npackages</a> (those packages were built for testing r600g, see <a href=\"http://lists.debian.org/debian-x/2011/05/msg00567.html\" title=\"Test report for r600g in Mesa 7.11\">this e-mail to debian-x</a>).\nr600g users also need to set <code>R600_S3TC_ENABLE=1</code>, otherwise the\ndriver won't attempt to load <tt>libtxc-dxtn0</tt>.</p>\n<p>For 32 bit applications (like Windows games run with Wine) the initial\nsetup is a little bit more involved: in addition to the above you also need to\nupdate a few libraries under <tt>/usr/lib32</tt>: namely Mesa and libdrm (if you\nuse my Mesa packages you need a i386 copy of libffi too). The quick and dirty\napproach is to download the i386 packages for <tt>libgl1-mesa-dri</tt>,\n<tt>libgl1-mesa-glx</tt>, <tt>libglu1-mesa</tt>, <tt>libdrm2</tt>,\n<tt>libdrm-intel1</tt>, <tt>libdrm-radeon1</tt> and (if you use my Mesa build)\n<tt>libffi5</tt>. Unpack the packages (<code>dpkg-deb -x</code>) and move the\nfiles under <tt>/path/to/unpack/dir/usr/lib</tt> to <tt>/usr/lib32</tt>.\nAlternatively you can also build a new <tt>ia32-libs</tt> package (make sure\nyou change the source.list file of <tt>ia32-libs</tt> to use at least testing\nas a base, otherwise you'll end up with basically the same versions as are\nin the current package).</p>\n<p>No matter how you updated your drivers you now need the 32 bit version of\n<tt>libtxc-dxtn0</tt>. debian-multimedia.org <a href=\"http://debian-multimedia.org/pool/main/i/ia32-libs-libtxc-dxtn0/ia32-libs-libtxc-dxtn0.php\" title=\"debian-multimedia.org: ia32-libs-libtxc-dxtn0\">offers a packaged\nversion</a>.</p>\n<p>After installing all the previous packages, Wine should be able to display\n(most) S3TC-using programs (in case you use the r600g driver, make sure you have\n<code>R600_S3TC_ENABLE=1</code> set). If you're using my Mesa builds you can\n<a href=\"http://www.carbon-project.org/Wine_with_3D_acceleration_on_amd64.html\" title=\"Wine with 3D acceleration on amd64\">drop the\n<code>LIBGL_DRIVERS_PATH=/usr/lib32/dri</code> part</a> again from your Wine\ninvocation.</p>\n<p>Please note, that there might be some S3TC-using applications with\ngraphical glitches, when using the above method, as the support for S3TC in\nr600g is still marked as <acronym title=\"Work In Progress\">WIP</acronym>.</p>"

      "content" : "<p>\nYesterday morning I was reading through the logs of my exim-based\nmailserver and noticed _how_ many messages were delivered to\nGoogle/Gmail.  This is mostly related to the various mailing lists that\nI'm hosting at <i>lists.{gnumonks,osmocom}.org</i>.\n</p>\n<p>\nNow if those lists were general-purpose mailing lists for let's say a\ngroup of environmentalists or a local model train club, I wouldn't be\nsurprised.  But almost all of those lists are about <i>very</i>\ntechnical projects, where the only subscriber base should be people from\neither the IT security community, or the Free Software community.  The\nformer is typically extremely security and privacy aware, whereas the\nlatter is at least to some extent in favor of what I would describe as\n'being a producer rather than just a consumer of technology.\n</p>\n<p>\nSo why is there such a high degree of Gmail usage among those groups? I\nreally don't get it.  Let me illustrate why this is a surprise:\n</p><ul>\n<li><b>you give away control over your personal data</b>\n<p>\nControl over your own data means you own it, you have it on your hard\ndisk, it is not on somebody else's storage medium.  Control over your\ndata also means that somebody needs a search warrant to your home in\norder to get to it.  It also means that you decide when or how to shut\nit down, not a large corporation in a foreign country.\n</p>\n</li>\n\n<li><b>you put your personal data within the U.S. jurisdiction</b>\n<p>\nDepending on where you are, this may or may not be an improvement.\nI don't want to start a political debate here, but you have to be aware\nwhat this means specifically, especially in terms of government\nauthorities or private companies getting access to your mails.  I myself\nwould not even say that I understand enough about the US legal system to\ndetermine the full outcome of this.  Also, in case there was a subpoena\nor other legal action in the US, how would I defend myself?  That's so\nmuch easier in my home country, where I know the laws and regulations.\n</p>\n</li>\n\n<li><b>you give Google not only the social web information who mails whom,\n    but also the full content of that communication</b>\n<p>\nNow Google may have privacy policies and other rules that this data is\nnot to be mined for whatever purposes they deem fit.  But first of all,\nwhat guarantees do you have on it?  Definitely less than if you ran your\nown mail server on your own hardware.  Secondly, whatever Google\npromises is always within the scope of the US jurisdiction.  In the\n10-year aftermath of 9/11 there have been a number of alarming\ndevelopments including wiretaps to phone lines without court\nreview/order, etc.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nNow I don't want this to be a bashing of Google.  The same applies more\nor less to any email hosting company.   I also don't want it to be a\nbashing about the US.  The above is meant as an example only.  In Europe\nwe have our own problems with regard to data retention of e-mail related\ndata (who is mailing whom).  But those only apply to companies that\noffer telecommunications services.  If you host your own mail server,\nyou are not providing services to anyone else and thus are not required\nto retain any data.\n</p>\n<p>\nThere's also what I would call the combination effect, i.e. millions of\nmillions of people all using the same service.  This leads to a large\nconcentration of information.   Such concentrations are ideal for data\nmining and to get a global 'who is who'.  This information is much more\ninteresting to e.g. intelligence communities than the actual content, as\nit is much easier analyzed automatically.  It also doesn't help to\nencrypt your messages, as the headers (From, To, ...) are still\nunencrypted.\n</p>\n<p>\nFurthermore, this concentration leads to single points of failure.  I'm\nnot speaking physically, as Google and other web-hosters of course know\nhow to replicate their services using a large-scale distributed system.\nBut all is under control by the same company, maintained by the same\nstaff, subject to the same jurisdiction/laws, etc.\n</p>\n<p>\nThere was a time when the Internet was about a heterogeneous network,\nde-centralized, without a single point of failure.  Why are all people\nrunning to a very few number of companies?  The same question goes for\nsites like sourceforge.  All the code hosted there subject to the good\nwill of the hosting company.  Subject to their financial stability,\ntheir intentions and their admin staff.   They've had security\nbreaches, as did apparently Google.  Sure, self-hosted machines also\nhave security breaches, but only the breakage of a very small set of\naccounts, not the breakage of thousands, hundred thousands or millions\nof users simultaneously.\n</p>\n<p>\nNow hosting your own mailserver on your own machine might be a bit too\nmuch effort in terms of money or work for some people.  I understand\nthat.  But then, there are several other options:\n</p><ul>\n<li>You team up with some friends, people you know and trust, and you\n    share the administrative and financial effort</li>\n<li>You look out for NGOs, societies, cooperatives or other\nnon-for-profit groups that offer email and other services to their\nmembers.  At least in Germany we traditionally have many of these.\n</li><li>You use a local, small Internet service company rather than one of\nthe big entities.\n</li></ul>\nWhile you still give up some control with those alternatives, you keep\nyour data within your jurisdiction, and you still keep the spirit of\nde-centralization rather than those large concentrated single point of\nfailures.\n<p></p>"

      "content" : "<p>One of the most often question I got, &quot;Since browser Foo and browser Bar are using the <b>same</b> WebKit engine, why do I get <b>different</b> feature set?&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s step aside a bit. Boeing 747, a very popular airliner, uses Pratt &amp; Whitney JT9D engine. So does Airbus A310. Do you expect both planes to have the same flight characteristics? Surely not, there are other bazillion factors which decide how that big piece of metal actually flies. In fact, you would not expect A310-certified pilot to just jump into 747 cockpit and land it.</p>\n\n<p>(Aviation fans, please forgive me if the above analogy is an oversimplification).</p>\n\n<p>WebKit, as a web rendering engine, is designed to use a lot of (semi)abstract <b>interfaces</b>. These interfaces obviously require (surprise) some <b>implementation</b>. Example of such interfaces are network stack, mouse + key handling, thread system, disk access, memory management, graphics pipeline, etc.</p>\n\n<p>What is the popular reference to WebKit is usually Apple's own flavor of WebKit which runs on Mac OS X (<a href=\"http://lists.kde.org/?l=kfm-devel&amp;m=104197092318639&amp;w=2\">the first and the original</a> WebKit library). As you can guess, the various interfaces are implemented using different native libraries on Mac OS X, mostly centered around <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/corefoundation/\">CoreFoundation</a>. For example, if you specify a flat colored button with specific border radius, well WebKit knows where and how to draw that button. However, the final actual responsibility of <b>drawing the button</b> (as pixels on the user's monitor) falls into <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/CoreGraphics/Reference/CoreGraphics_Framework/_index.html\">CoreGraphics</a>.</p>\n\n<p>With time, WebKit was &quot;ported&quot; into different platform, both desktop and mobile. Such flavor is often called &quot;WebKit port&quot;. For Safari Windows, Apple themselves also ported WebKit to run on Windows, using the <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/opensource/internet/webkit_sptlib_agree.html\">Windows version</a> of its (limited implementation of) CoreFoundation library.</p>\n\n<p>Beside that, there were many other &quot;ports&quot; as well (see <a href=\"http://trac.webkit.org/wiki#WebKitPorts\">the full list</a>). Via its Chrome browser (and the Chromium sister project), Google has created and continues to maintain its Chromium port. There is also WebKitGtk which is based on Gtk+. Nokia (through Trolltech, which it acquired) maintains the Qt port of WebKit, popular as its <a href=\"http://doc.qt.nokia.com/qtwebkit.html\">QtWebKit module</a>.</p>\n\n<p>(This explains why any beginner scream like &quot;Help! I can&#39;t build WebKit on platform FooBar&quot; would likely get an <a href=\"https://lists.webkit.org/pipermail/webkit-help/2009-August/000146.html\">instant reply</a> &quot;Which port are you trying to build?&quot;).</p>\n\n<p>Consider QtWebKit, it's even possible (through customized <a href=\"http://doc.qt.nokia.com/qnetworkaccessmanager.html\">QNetworkAccessManager</a>, thanks to Qt network modularity) to hook a different network backend. This is for example what is being done for KDEWebKit module so that it becomes the Qt port of WebKit which actually uses KDE libraries to access the network.</p>\n\n<p>If we come back to the rounded button example, again the real drawing is carried out in the actual graphics library used by the said WebKit port. Here is a simplified diagram that shows the mapping:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/--WfQB-Tr1sQ/TfHQSfY38FI/AAAAAAAAB8s/DSNAn8F71i8/s800/graphicscontext.png\"></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://trac.webkit.org/browser/trunk/Source/WebCore/platform/graphics/GraphicsContext.h\">GraphicsContext</a> is the interface. All other code inside WebKit will not &quot;speak&quot; directly to e.g. CoreGraphics on Mac. In the above rounded button example, it will call GraphicsContext&#39;s fillRoundedRect() function.</p>\n\n<p>There are various implementation of GraphicsContext, depending on the port. For Qt, you can see how it is done in <a href=\"http://trac.webkit.org/browser/trunk/Source/WebCore/platform/graphics/qt/GraphicsContextQt.cpp#L744\">GraphicsContextQt.cpp</a> file.</p>\n\n<p>Should you know a little bit about graphics, you would realize that there are different methods and algorithms to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasterisation\">rasterize</a> a filled rounded rectangle. A certain approach is to convert it to a <a href=\"http://doc.qt.nokia.com/qpainterpath.html#toFillPolygon\">fill polygon</a>, another one is to scanline-convert the rounded corner directly. A fully GPU-based system may prefer working with tessellated <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_strip\">triangle strips</a>, or even with shader. Even the antialiasing level defines the outcome, too.</p>\n\n<p>In short, different graphic stacks with different algorithm may not produce the same result down to the exact pixel colors. It all depends various factors, including the complexity of the drawing itself.</p>\n\n<p>Now the same concept applies to other interfaces. For example, there is no HTTP stack inside WebKit code base. All network-aware code calls specific function to get resources off the server, post some data, etc. However, the actual implementation is in system libraries. Thus, don't bother trying to find SSL code inside WebKit.</p>\n\n<p>This gets us to this question, &quot;If browser X is using WebKit, why it does not have feature Z?&quot;. You may be able to deduce the reason. Imagine a certain graphic stack which glues GraphicsContext for that platform does not implement fillRoundedRect() function, what would happen? Yes, your rounded button suddenly becomes a <b>square</b> button.</p>\n\n<p>As a matter of fact, when someone ports WebKit to a new platform, she will need to implement all these interfaces one by one. Until it is complete, of course not everything would work 100% and most likely only the basics are there. That should feel like putting a jet engine into an airframe that can't fly yet.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Can we have one de-facto graphics stack that powers WebKit so we always have pixel-perfect rendering expectation?&quot; Technically yes, but practically no. In fact, while Boeing and Airbus may buy the same engine from Pratt &amp; Whitney, they may not want to have the exact same landing gears. Everyone of us wants to be <b>special</b>. A certain system wants to use OpenGL ES, squeeze the best performance out of it and doesn't really care if the selling price goes up. Others want to sacrifice the speed, trim the silicon floor and make the device more affordable. More often, you just have to live with diversity.</p>\n\n<p>And if you want to put aside all the differences, two WebKit ports of the same revision share tons of stuff, especially if they use the same JavaScript engine. They will parse HTML and CSS in the same way, produce the same DOM, yield the same render tree, have the same JavaScript host objects, and so on.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, next time someone shouts &quot;there is no two exact WebKit&quot;, you know the story behind it.</p><div><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/17722541-8222658530873639291?l=ariya.blogspot.com\" alt=\"\"></div>"

Usenet is only getting a trickle of posts\neach day -- it's still in that period where it's easy to read every message\nposted to it.</p>\n\n<p>Many things lie in Usenet's future. It's still running <a href=\"https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/A%2DNews\">A-News</a>,\nwhich doesn't even have a real From header yet. Later this year it will switch\nover to <a href=\"https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/B%2DNews\">B-News</a>, and volume will begin to increase. In 1987\nthere will be <a href=\"https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/The%5Fgreat%5Frenaming\">The great renaming</a>. And of course in 1994,\nthe first spam will be posted to Usenet.</p>\n\n<p>But that's all a long way off, here in 1981. Right now, they're talking\nabout <a href=\"http://olduse.net/img/news-screenshot6.png\">500 mb disk drives that only cost $38000</a>.\nAnd rms is <a href=\"http://olduse.net/img/news-screenshot3.png\">inciting flames about nuclear proliferation</a>.\nAnd <a href=\"http://olduse.net/img/news-screenshot5-postel.png\">Postel is publishing an RFC for the new Mail Transfer Protocol</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Good morning, Usenet. Who knows what will come next in this fledgeling\nelectronic communications medium!</p>\n\n<h3>a ten year real-time historical exhibit</h3>\n\n<p>This morning, I'm announcing a new site: <strong><a href=\"http://olduse.net/\">Olduse.net</a></strong></p>\n\n<p>It's Usenet, updated in real time as it was thirty years ago. Planned to be\navailable for the next ten years, unless I run out of inodes (again).</p>\n\n<p>If you missed it the first time around, this is your chance to follow\nUsenet's flowering.</p>\n\n<h3>made possible by</h3>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://www.csd.uwo.ca/staff/magi/personal/usenet/MeAndTapes_320x256.jpg\" align=\"right\" alt=\"141 magtape usenet archive\"></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Henry Spencer at the University of Toronto, Department of Zoology,\nwho archived Usenet.

It’s been few days since the official coding phase started. Most of the time I’ve been figuring out the details regarding integration of non-x86 images to the Eucalyptus IaaS and working on the ARM image, as you’ll learn later. I’m also in the process of starting to design the set of tools we’ll be delivering as part of the project.</p>\n<p>The project’s goal is to be a useful resource for Debian developers and porters. I’ve joined some porters list in order to learn what are the things they are struggling with and how the project can help to address them. I’ll be starting a wiki page with such topics.</p>\n<p>Bonding period:<br>\nBonding period has been more fruitful than I expected. As mentioned in my previous post, Steffen and I got in touch with the Eucalyptus team, since they show their early interest on the project. We are coordinating cooperation between our teams. Besides my mentor and I defined to start working on the ARM image. Coordination went OK. We’ll be having meetings every two weeks.</p>\n<p>Project Status:<br>\nResuming Dominique’s <a href=\"http://wiki.debian.org/Cloud/CreateImage\">work</a> I began working on the ARM image. Aurélien’s <a href=\"http://www.aurel32.net/info/debian_arm_qemu.php\">work</a> was a great resource. Currently I have a working and updated Debian testing ARM image using the versatile kernel that can be used under qemu-arm. I’m currently making tests and figuring out the next phase which is “cloudify” it. Over this weekend I expect to finish on that side and then began on the design and implementation of the tools that will be the project’s result.</p>\n<address>Until now I haven’t faced much issues, but the Eucalyptus part since the docs are targeting x86 and amd_64 archs. However I think I can run qemu-arm on top. I’ll talk to them about the idea.<br>\n</address>\n<p>Future plans:</p>\n<p>week 3:</p>\n<p>- Finish tests with the ARM image.</p>\n<p>- Design the base tool-set, thinking integration with dpkg-buildpackage and <a href=\"http://wiki.debian.org/qemubuilder\">qemubuilder</a>.</p>\n<p>week 4-8:</p>\n<p>- Write the necessary code.</p>\n<p>mid-term evaluation.</p>\n<p>Other bits:</p>\n<p>Latest days have been quite busy for me, since I’m still have to attend class, my semester ends in five weeks. This week was quite overwhelming with “media”, my University published an <a href=\"http://www.ucsp.edu.pe/index.php/noticias/46-notas-de-prensa/1687-alumno-ucsp-desarrollara-proyecto-para-google.html\">article</a> (Spanish) about me and the program. I’m the third student of the CS school participating in GSoC, in the past we had Gentoo Project and KDE students. Later, a local Cable TV program interview me on the same matter, it went fine. I managed to talk about Debian and what we do (we get free Advertising yay!) :) also about Google’s Summer of Code program and invited students to participate both in FLOSS projects and the program. Still don’t know if they have put it on air, I think it will be next week.</p>"

      "content" : "<p></p><p>If you have used the OpenGL module in Qt then at one point or another you may have found yourself  wanting to execute some of that OpenGL in a separate thread. The underlying OpenGL implementation itself is (mostly) re-entrant so there was really nothing stopping you. In fact, waaay back in the 6th edition of Qt Quarterly we even had an <a href=\"http://doc.qt.nokia.com/qq/qq06-glimpsing.html#writingmultithreadedglapplications\">article</a> describing how you could do this. This was fine for people spending most of their time writing pure OpenGL, but what about if you wanted to use some of the Qt convenience classes in a separate thread? Unfortunately that wasn’t possible because those Qt classes were not thread-safe. With Qt 4.8, this has changed and we have now added support for a few of the most common scenarios. To use the new functionality on X11 you need to enable the <a href=\"http://doc.qt.nokia.com/master-snapshot/qt.html#ApplicationAttribute-enum\">Qt::AA_X11InitThreads</a> application attribute to ensure that the underlying calls to GLX are thread-safe, but for Windows and Mac OS X it should work out of the box.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Buffer swapping thread</strong></p>\n<p>Depending on your driver and GPU, the call to swapBuffers() can sometimes be an expensive function call (especially on embedded processors). In many cases, this is the function that tells the GPU to take all of your render commands and execute them to render the current frame. If this operation is synchronous then your main thread is blocked while the GPU is doing its thing. That’s unfortunate because your current thread has much better things to do than wait for the GPU. For example, it could return to the event loop and process some user input, network traffic or advance the next scene of an animation. The solution to this in 4.8 is to have a separate thread whose sole purpose in life is to wait for the GPU by calling swapBuffers. In practice you would render everything as normal in your main thread, but instead of calling swapBuffers(), you would call doneCurrent() on the current GL context. You would then notify the swapping thread that you have finished rendering and it would call makeCurrent() to make the context active and then call swapBuffers(). The swapping thread should then call doneCurrent() and notify the main thread that it has finished. Note, there is a context switch here and this overhead may actually be slower than if the main thread had just waited for the GPU to finish so it’s important that you test this to see if you actually gain anything.<strong> </strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Texture uploading thread</strong></p>\n<p>Uploading many (or large) textures is typically an expensive operation because of the amount of data being pushed to the GPU. Again, this is one of those operations that can unnecessarily block your main thread. In 4.8 you can solve this problem by creating a pair of shared QGLWidgets. One of the widgets is made current in a separate thread, <em>but is never made visible on screen</em>. The main thread informs the uploading thread which images to upload and the uploading thread simply calls bindTexture() on each of these images and then notifies the main thread when each one has finished so it can be drawn to screen.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>QPainter thread</strong></p>\n<p>In 4.8 it is now possible to use QPainter in a separate thread to render to a QGLWidget, QGLPixelBuffer and QGLFrameBufferObject assuming you are using the OpenGL [ES] 2.0 paint engine. It’s important to note that QGLWidget <em>does not</em> get moved to a secondary thread (it’s a QWidget afterall). However, since its context will be used elsewhere, it is necessary to call doneCurrent() on the QGLWidget to release the context from the main thread. Next you should create a separate QObject subclass that can be moved to the secondary painter thread. This QObject will make the QGLWidget’s context current in the painter thread and can then open a QPainter on the target and start painting. If you are using QGLWidget as the target, then you additionally need to set the “﻿Qt::WA_PaintOutsidePaintEvent” attribute on the QGLWidget. Additionally, you will need to subclass and reimplement the resizeEvent() and paintEvent() functions of QGLWidget. The default implementation of these will try to make the QGLWidget’s context current and since these functions are called from the main thread (where the widget lives) we don’t want that to happen since we’re using the context in the painter thread. In your reimplementation of these functions, you should notify the QObject subclass that does the rendering so it can go and resize the viewport or repaint the scene if needed. The result of all this can be seen below in a new demo called <em>glhypnotizer </em>which runs several MDI subwindows containing a QGLWidget rendering from a separate thread.<em><br>\n</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"http://labs.qt.nokia.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/glhypnotizer-demo.png\"><img title=\"glhypnotizer-demo\" src=\"http://labs.qt.nokia.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/glhypnotizer-demo.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"698\" height=\"333\"></a>\n\t<p>Screenshot of demos/glhypnotizer in Qt 4.8</p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>"

In these older browsers you may have trouble using certain features in Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Talk, Google Docs and Google Sites, and eventually these apps may stop working entirely.</blockquote>\n\n<p>Given the importance of Google, the impact is huge. This company has acquired the power to basically dictate what browser you can provide to your users - otherwise they won’t be able to access what many of them now consider vital functionality.</p>\n\n<p><b>Such a decision denotes a grave misunderstanding of the workstation ecosystem</b> from the Google people. It means they consider their only target to be nerdy users with home computers they can (and want to) upgrade and break every 3 months with the latest version of Windows or Fedora. What about corporate computers? What about non-techy people who buy a computer and stick with the OS that was sold with it for 4 years? I’m afraid they are still the vast majority of web users. You can’t decide to deploy a new version of IE of Firefox on a large number of computers for next month. Sometimes, this is not even possible (hello Windows 2000/XP users).</p>\n\n<p>For Debian <i>squeeze</i>, this means no more Firefox for you. Epiphany and Konqueror might still work, but Google loves sending JavaScript that make old versions of Webkit struggle. And anyway, this is just the beginning. In a few months they will tell us to upgrade again to Firefox 4.2 and IE 12. One week after their release, yeah!</p>\n\n<p>Let’s quote a comment which should help understanding the reasoning behind such decisions.</p>\n<blockquote><i><p>Andy, while I understand staying on LTS, I think it's a little bit silly to use a mission critical machine for web browsing in that way. Also, there is no reason your browser has to be tied in lockstep to your OS.</p>\n\n<p>Two simple solutions:<br>\n1. Don't use the built-in browser for your main web browsing. Install Chrome, for example.\nor,<br>\n2. Since LTS is designed for servers and other \"can't have any chance of downtime\" machines, quit using that machine as your web browsing box and use a personal laptop for such things, which you can keep up to date with the current OS release instead of waiting 2 years.</p></i></blockquote>\n\n<p><b>Belief #1:</b> “the browser can (and should) be independent from the OS”. It’s interesting to note that the same people who say this are the ones who also jerk off at the idea of desktops and phones with tight web integration. This integration comes at a cost: this restricts your ability to change everything in the browser from one day to another.</p>\n\n<p><b>Belief #2:</b> “long-term OSes are for mission-critical servers only”. Yeah sure, that’s why Windows has a lifecycle of 3 years. <i>Desktops are no different at all from servers on this matter.</i> You don’t upgrade your desktop every 6 months when you do serious work with it; the cost and the risk are just too high. And anyway, this comes again from the same people who want to upgrade every single component of said mission-critical servers every 2 months to install the latest version of their preferred web framework.</p>\n\n<p><b>Belief #3:</b> “people can upgrade their browsers or OSes”. No really they can’t. Many people wouldn’t know how to do this, even with a step-by-step documentation. And in enterprise deployments, they are restricted from doing so.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for spreading the <i>cliché</i> that web developers are clueless, spotty nerds, incapable of understanding the needs of production environments. Apparently Google is not exempt from this disease.</p>"

      "content" : "As of late I'm noticing a trend: I'm spending more time having in-person in-depth conversations, and less time coding. While I regret the latter, I really enjoy the former. Certainly more than weekly meetings,  code reviews, or bikeshedding email threads. (I'm not all that excited about blogging either, as you may have guessed; but some things just don't fit in 140 characters.)<br><br>Two conversations with visitors I particularly enjoyed this week were both with very happy Python users, and yet they couldn't be more different. This to me is a confirmation of Python's enduring depth and breadth: it is as far away of a one-trick language as you can imagine.<br><br>My first visitor was <a href=\"http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/%7Eliu/\">Annie Liu</a>, a professor of computer science (with a tendency to theory :-) at Stony Brook University in New York State. During an animated conversation that lasted nearly three hours (and still she had more to say :-) she explained to me the gist of her research, which appears to be writing small Python programs that implement fundamental algorithms using set comprehensions, and then optimizing the heck out of it using an automated approach she summarized as the three I's: Iterate, incrementalize, and implement. While her academic colleagues laugh at her for her choice of such a non-theoretical language like Python, her students love it, and she seems to be having the last laugh, obtaining publication-worthy results that don't require advanced LaTeX skills, nor writing in a dead language like SETL (of which she is also a great fan, and which, via ABC, had some influence on Python -- see also below).<br><br>Annie told me an amusing anecdote about an inscrutable security standard produced by NiST a decade ago, with a fifty-page specification written in Z. She took a 12-page portion of it and translated it into a 120-line Python program, which was much more readable than the original, and in the process she uncovered some bugs in the spec!<br><br>Another anecdote she recounted had reached me before, but somehow I had forgotten about it until she reminded me. It concerns the origins of Python's use of indentation. The anecdote takes place long before Python was created. At an IFIP working group meeting in a hotel, one night the delegates could not agree about the best delimiters to use for code blocks. On the table were the venerable BEGIN ... END, the newcomers { ... }, and some oddities like IF ... FI and indentation. In desperation someone said the decision had to be made by a non-programmer. The only person available was apparently Robert Dewar's wife, who in those days traveled with her husband to these events. Despite the late hour, she was called down from her hotel room and asked for her independent judgement. Immediately she decided that structuring by pure indentation was the winner. Now, I've probably got all the details wrong here, but apparently Lambert Meertens was present, who went on to design Python's predecessor, ABC, though at the time he called it <span style=\"font-style:italic\">B</span> (the italics meant that <span style=\"font-style:italic\">B</span> was not the name of the language, but the name of the variable containing the name of the language). I checked my personal archives, and the first time I heard this was from Prof. Paul Hilfinger at Berkeley, who recounted a similar story. In his version, it was just Lambert Meertens and Robert Dewar, and Robert Dewar's wife chose indentation because she wanted to go to bed. Either way it is a charming and powerful story. <span style=\"font-weight:bold\">(UPDATE: indeed <a href=\"http://python-history.blogspot.com/2011/07/karin-dewar-indentation-and-colon.html\">the real story</a> was quite different.)</span><br><br>Of course Annie had some requests as well. I'll probably go over these in more detail on python-ideas, but here's a quick rundown (of what I could remember):<br><ul><li>Quantifiers. She is really longing for the \"<a href=\"http://homepages.cwi.nl/%7Esteven/abc/qr.html#TESTS\">SOME x IN xs HAS pred</a>\" notation from ABC (and its sibling \"EACH x IN xs HAS pred\"), which superficially resemble Python's any() and all() functions, but have the added semantics of making x available in the scope executed when the test succeeds (or fails, in the case of EACH -- then x represents a counterexample).</li><li>Type declarations. (Though I think she would be happy with Python 3 function annotations, possibly augmented with the attribute declarations seen in e.g. Django and App Engine's model classes.)</li><li>Pattern matching, a la Erlang. I have been eying these myself from time to time; it is hard to find a syntax that really shines, but it seems to be a useful feature.</li><li>Something she calls labels or yield points. It seems somewhat similar to yield statements in generators, but not quite.</li><li>She has only recently begun to look at distributed algorithms (she had some Leslie Lamport anecdotes as well) and might prefer sets to be immutable after all. Though that isn't so clear; her work so far has actually benefited from mutating sets to maintain some algorithmic invariant. (The \"incrementalize\" of the three I's actually refers to a form of \"differentiation\" of expressions that produce a new set for each input.)</li></ul>The contrast with my visitor the next day couldn't be greater. Through a former colleague I got an introduction to Drew Houston, co-founder and CEO of the vastly successful start-up company <a href=\"http://www.dropbox.com/\">Dropbox</a>. Dropbox currently has 25 million users, stores petabytes of data on Amazon S3, is profitable, and is not for sale. Drew is an easygoing MIT graduate who is equally comfortable discussing custom memory allocators, the world of venture capitalism, and how to keep engineers happy; he likes hard problems and winning.<br><br>Python plays an important role in Dropbox's success: the Dropbox client, which runs on Windows, Mac and Linux (!), is written in Python. This is key to the portability: everything except the UI is cross-platform. (The UI uses a Python-ObjC bridge on Mac, and wxPython on the other platforms.) Performance has never been a problem -- understanding that a small number of critical pieces were written in C, including a custom memory allocator used for a certain type of objects whose pattern of allocation involves allocating 100,000s of them and then releasing all but a few. Before you jump in to open up the Dropbox distro and learn all about how it works, beware that the source code is not included and the bytecode is obfuscated. Drew's no fool. And he laughs at the poor competitors who are using Java.<br><br>Next Monday I'm  having lunch with another high-tech enterpreneur, a Y-combinator start-up founder using (and contributing to) App Engine. Maybe I should just cancel all weekly meetings and sign off from all mailing lists and focus on two things: meeting Python users and coding. That's the life!"

      "content" : "You'd think it'd be easy to reboot a PC, wouldn't you? But then you'd also think that it'd be straightforward to convince people that at least making some effort to be nice to each other would be a mutually beneficial proposal, and look how well that's worked for us.<br><br>Linux has a bunch of different ways to reset an x86. Some of them are 32-bit only and so I'm just going to ignore them because honestly just what are you doing with your life. Also, they're horrible. So, that leaves us with five of them.<br><ul><li>kbd - reboot via the keyboard controller. The original IBM PC had the CPU reset line tied to the keyboard controller. Writing the appropriate magic value pulses the line and the machine resets. This is all very straightforward, except for the fact that modern machines don't have keyboard controllers (they're actually part of the embedded controller) and even more modern machines don't even pretend to have a keyboard controller. Now, embedded controllers run software. And, as we all know, software is dreadful. But, worse, the software on the embedded controller has been written by BIOS authors. So clearly any pretence that this ever works is some kind of elaborate fiction. Some machines are very picky about hardware being in the exact state that Windows would program. Some machines work 9 times out of 10 and then lock up due to some odd timing issue. And others simply don't work at all. Hurrah!<br></li><li>triple - attempt to generate a triple fault. This is done by loading an empty interrupt descriptor table and then calling int(3). The interrupt fails (there's no IDT), the fault handler fails (there's no IDT) and the CPU enters a condition which should, in theory, then trigger a reset. Except there doesn't seem to be a requirement that this happen and it just doesn't work on a bunch of machines.<br></li><li>pci - not actually pci. Traditional PCI config space access is achieved by writing a 32 bit value to io port 0xcf8 to identify the bus, device, function and config register. Port 0xcfc then contains the register in question. But if you write the appropriate pair of magic values to 0xcf9, the machine will reboot. Spectacular! And not standardised in any way (certainly not part of the PCI spec), so different chipsets may have different requirements. Booo.<br></li><li>efi - EFI runtime services provide an entry point to reboot the machine. It usually even works! As long as EFI runtime services are working at all, which may be a stretch.<br></li><li>acpi - Recent versions of the ACPI spec let you provide an address (typically memory or system IO space) and a value to write there. The idea is that writing the value to the address resets the system. It turns out that doing so often fails. It's also impossible to represent the PCI reboot method via ACPI, because the PCI reboot method requires a pair of values and ACPI only gives you one.</li></ul><br>Now, I'll admit that this all sounds pretty depressing. But people clearly sell computers with the expectation that they'll reboot correctly, so what's going on here?<br><br>A while back I did some tests with Windows running on top of qemu. This is a great way to evaluate OS behaviour, because you've got complete control of what's handed to the OS and what the OS tries to do to the hardware. And what I discovered was a little surprising. In the absence of an ACPI reboot vector, Windows will hit the keyboard controller, wait a while, hit it again and then give up. If an ACPI reboot vector is present, windows will poke it, try the keyboard controller, poke the ACPI vector again and try the keyboard controller one more time.<br><br>This turns out to be important. The first thing it means is that it generates two writes to the ACPI reboot vector. The second is that it leaves a gap between them while it's fiddling with the keyboard controller. And, shockingly, it turns out that on most systems the ACPI reboot vector points at 0xcf9 in system IO space. Even though most implementations nominally require two different values be written, it seems that this isn't a strict requirement and the ACPI method works.<br><br>3.0 will ship with this behaviour by default. It makes various machines work (some Apples, for instance), improves things on some others (some Thinkpads seem to sit around for extended periods of time otherwise) and hopefully avoids the need to add any more machine-specific quirks to the reboot code. There's still some divergence between us and Windows (mostly in how often we write to the keyboard controller), which can be cleaned up if it turns out to make a difference anywhere.<br><br>Now.

But it's simple: the generated stubs fail to validate the replies with varying subclasses (e.g. when VMware returns an HttpFcLease with several devices of different types). This cannot be worked around by hand-editing the WSDL (obviously). You have to use C++ or something else.</li>\n<li>When gcc 4.x compiles gSOAP stubs, it can easily use several gigabytes of RAM for cc1. Using swap does not cut it: it will just page forever. Possibly the generated code makes its hash sizing heuristics blow up. Either build with gcc 2.95 or discard gSOAP and hand-roll all the calls.</li>\n<li>Libvirt has an ESX driver. Bolte wrote it, it's sensible code, but unfortunately uses Python to generate stubs. Also, a bit big for a 2500 line scriptlet.</li>\n<li>VirtualBox has a back-end of \"stream-optimized\" VMDKs.

They give us the internet, but they also give us an\ninternet full of monopolistic worse-is-better players that use network\neffects to stifle improvements and competition.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes the best you can manage is to be a parasite.</p>\n\n<h2>facebook</h2>\n\n<p>So I'm back on facebook ... sort of.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://kitenet.net/~joey/blog/./pics/facebook.png\"><img src=\"http://kitenet.net/~joey/blog/./pics/facebook.png\" alt=\"a nearly empty facebook profile encouraging use of email or blog\" height=\"329\" width=\"823\"></a></p>\n\n<p>My strategy for facebook is to be as near to a featureless datapoint as I\ncan. I won't post anything. I entered as bad quality information as I could\nget away with. I turned all privacy controls off, on the theory that this\nway I don't have to worry about facebook eroding privacy since everything\nabout me on facebook is aggressively public.</p>\n\n<p>By never posting anything to facebook, I am trying to fight the\nnetwork effect; trying to avoid increasing the value of facebook due to\nme being on it.</p>\n\n<p>I've adblocked the text entry field on facebook just to avoid\nthe temptation. I want to erase the Like buttons too. Technologically,\nI think a good approach would be a browser plugin that does these things\nwhile extracting all available content and optionally sending it to a\n<a href=\"https://www.recapthelaw.org/\">RECAP</a>-type system.</p>\n\n<p>I only friend people who I need to keep up with and who have little\nor no other internet presence. This is because I am aware that each person\nI friend still propels facebook's network effect a little bit; even though\nthey'll never see any useful information from me, they will know that they\nare able to talk <em>to</em> me via facebook. </p>\n\n<p>I only log into facebook once a week or so (this is easy when you're not\ninteracting with it anyway), and read whatever sample of farmville and\nother posts facebook selects as \"important\" (worse than usual probably\nsince I never give it feedback). So people I friend can't rely on me\nreading everything they do, which reduces the value a little more.</p>\n\n<p>I will probably delete this account occasionally, and then re-add it later.\nJust often enough to be really annoying.</p>\n\n<h2>twitter</h2>\n\n<p>Similarly, I no longer gate <a href=\"http://identi.ca/joeyhess\">my identi.ca account</a>\nto twitter, and have deleted as many tweets as I could stand to\n(one click and one keypress per tweet; no mass-delete; ugh!), and protected\nmy account to avoid accidential new tweets leaking out.</p>\n\n<p>Since twitter is not quite as evil as facebook I feel slightly less bad about\nexposing more of my social graph there. Only the folks who are too lame to get\non an OpenMicroBlogging site like identi.ca.</p>\n\n<h2>phone</h2>\n\n<p>Of course there was a network effect with the telephone as well, and while\nit got deregulated it's still pretty bad, and also a technology that I\nmostly dislike using. Oddly my phone behavior is backwards to the other\ntwo networks; I only make outgoing phone calls, never answering the phone\n(unless real life intervenes very severely). I listen to some random\nfraction of my voice mail and read whatever ones manage to get\nmachine-transcribed.</p>"

      "content" : "<img src=\"http://planet.debian.org/heads/bernat.png\" width=\"67\" height=\"82\" alt=\"\" align=\"right\" style=\"float:right\">  <p>Nowadays, many websites provide a mobile version, like\n<a href=\"http://en.m.wikipedia.org\">Wikipedia</a>, which usually is a version\ntailored to device with less bandwidth and smaller\nscreen. <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/\"><span>CSS</span> Media Queries</a> is a candidate recommendation from\nthe <abbr title=\"World Wide Web Consortium\"><span>W3C</span></abbr> to support different stylesheets depending on the how the\ndocument is displayed. This allows to build a mobile version just by\nproviding additional instructions in your <span>CSS</span> style sheet.</p>\n<h1>Using <span>CSS</span> Media Queries</h1>\n<p>There are two ways to use <span>CSS</span> media queries. You can provide an\nadditional <span>CSS</span> stylesheet and let the browser knows when to use it:</p>\n<table><tbody><tr><td><div><pre>1</pre></div></td><td><div><pre><span>&lt;link</span> <span>rel=</span><span>\"stylesheet\"</span> <span>media=</span><span>\"screen and (max-width: 700px)\"</span> <span>href=</span><span>\"mobile.css\"</span><span>&gt;</span>\n</pre></div>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n<p>When the width of the viewport is less than 700 pixels, the stylesheet\n<code>mobile.css</code> will be used. Another way to use <span>CSS</span> media queries is to\ndeclare a section inside your current <span>CSS</span> style sheet:</p>\n<table><tbody><tr><td><div><pre>1\n2\n3\n4\n5</pre></div></td><td><div><pre><span>@media</span> <span>screen</span> <span>and</span> <span>(</span><span>max-width</span><span>:</span> <span>700px</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>\n    <span>#article</span> <span>{</span>\n       <span>margin</span><span>:</span> <span>0.3em</span> <span>0.2em</span><span>;</span>\n    <span>}</span>\n<span>}</span>\n</pre></div>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n<p>While there are many available properties, the most two common ones\nwill be <code>max-width</code> and <code>min-width</code>. You can use this feature to\nmodify some aspects of your web site like reducing margins or hiding\nsome extra navigational blocks.</p>\n<h1>Browser support</h1>\n<p>Current versions of mobile browsers\n<a href=\"http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-media\">support <span>CSS</span> media queries</a>: Safari Mobile, Android browser\nand Opera mobile will handle it without a glitch. If you use <span>CSS</span> media\nqueries to provide a mobile version of your web site, you don’t really\nhave to worry about browser compatibility.</p>\n<p>There exists <a href=\"http://remysharp.com/2010/10/08/what-is-a-polyfill/\">polyfills</a> that will enable this feature on\nunsupported browsers like Internet Explorer 8. One of them is\n<a href=\"https://github.com/scottjehl/Respond\">Respond</a> which is a lightweight polyfill targeted at\nsupporting only <code>min-width</code> and <code>max-width</code> in Internet Explorer 6, 7 and 8.</p>\n<h1>Example</h1>\n<p>I have added <span>CSS</span> media queries to my website. Try it by resizing the\nwindow of your browser. Here are some of the changes depending on the\nwidth of the window:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the sidebar transforms into a topbar</li>\n<li>the search box is hidden</li>\n<li>padding is reduced at various places</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here is the current look in a classic browser:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://media.luffy.cx/images/css-media-query-large.jpg\" alt=\"Website look on a classic browser\"></p>\n<p>If you reduce the size of your window, you will get something like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://media.luffy.cx/images/css-media-query-small.jpg\" alt=\"Website look on a narrow window\"></p>\n<p>Browse my <a href=\"https://github.com/vincentbernat/www.luffy.cx/tree/master/content/media/css\"><span>CSS</span> files</a> for more examples. Look at the end of each\nfile. For further information, have a look at the\n<a href=\"http://css-tricks.com/css-media-queries/\">article from <span>CSS</span> Tricks</a>.</p>"

If there is no cryptographic\nrestriction on only booting HTC-supplied versions of the Linux kernel\n(and other software), this is good news!\n</p>\n<p>\nIt comes as a bit of surprise though.  \"Traditionally\", HTC is known for\nbehaving unfriendly towards the community.  Not only due to their source\ncode releases being constantly too late, but also due to the fact that\ntheir phones were some of the first to use cryptographic signatures to\nkeep people from installing their own versions of Linux (and Android).\n</p>\n<p>\nThe other surprising move has come from Motorola, who probably has the\nlongest tradition of shipping Linux-based phones (in various degrees of\nGPL compliance), but then using technical means to deprive their\ncustomers of the Freedoms the GPL wants to grant to them, i.e. the\nfreedom to run modified versions of the Software (Linux in this case).\nThey did this with the later models of the EZX range, with their MAGX\nphones, as well as now with their Android phones over the last couple of\nyears.  So it was very puzzling to see the same Motorola <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/Motorola/status/40166376467341312\">announce a 180\ndegree turn in policy</a> at least for their Xoom tablet.\n</p>\n<p>\nAlso, in recent news, Sony Ericsson made a similar announcement that at\nleast <a href=\"http://unlockbootloader.sonyericsson.com/instructions\">some of\ntheir Xperia models can be bootloader unlocked</a>.\n</p>\n<p>\nIt's really striking.  During the least seven years, I used to be\ninvolved in a number of projects that tried to enable the user of mobile\nsmartphones to have the full source code for (at least) the Linux\nkernel, and to be able to modify, tinker and re-program it any way they\nwant.  Now some of the vendors seem to be moving in the right direction.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhat's sad is that Samsung is not capitalizing on their potential here.\nThey have always had very timely and complete source code releases\nfor all their Linux based phones at http://opensource.samsung.com/, and\nthey have very rarely tried to lock any of the bootloaders.  I don't\nknow if this is intentional or not.  But now the other vendors are\ngetting good PR for stopping to do something that (to my knowledge)\nSamsung has not done, at least not to the extent of the others.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn any case, I still think the Nexus S is the best choice for anyone who\nwants to have a developer friendly device.  It is fully supported in the\nmain AOSP tree, everything in the kernel is GPLv2, and those binary\nuserspace blobs that are required are distributed independently at\n<a href=\"https://code.google.com/android/nexus/drivers.html\">https://code.google.com/android/nexus/drivers.html</a> so they can be\nintegrated into custom  builds.  This is by no means perfect, but the\nbest compromise that seems available at this point.  I still don't\nunderstand why the userspace drivers for the GSM/3G modem, Wifi,\nBluetooth and GPS would need to be proprietary.  Or even the NFC par,\nit's sort-of ridiculous to have that proprietary with Free Software RFID stacks like libnfc and\nlibrfid around...\n</p>"

Personally it was (always) fun to meet my former coworkers from <a href=\"http://qt.nokia.com\">Qt, Nokia</a> and other KDE folks and catch up and exchange tech gossips. I am also excited to get to know <a href=\"http://appdeveloper.intel.com/meego\">MeeGo team</a> from Intel side as well. The conference itself is professionally organized. The <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=meegoconf%20hacker%20lounge\">Hacker Lounge</a> idea is perfect, a basement to hang out 24 hours with free cold drinks, lots of games (from fussball to pingpong), superfast and reliable WiFi, and of course a bunch of comfy couches. <a href=\"http://www.sanfranciscoregency.hyatt.com/hyatt/hotels/index.jsp\">Hyatt Regency</a> itself proves to be a really really nice venue from such a developer conference.</p>\n\n<p>The three-day <a href=\"http://sf2011.meego.com/program/session-schedule\">program</a> was packed with tons of sessions, anything from Qt 5, Wayland, Scene Graph, Media and IVI, and various other BoFs. Lots of exciting new technologies coming to the next version of MeeGo! Oh BTW, the releases will be every 6 months, expect MeeGo 1.3 in October 2011, along with its experimental Wayland support.</p>\n\n<p>From the device-give-away perspective, Intel threw a lot of <a href=\"http://www.techonia.com/meego-tablet-exopc-1-2\">ExoPC tablets</a> (flashed with MeeGo 1.2 preview), as part of its <a href=\"http://appup.com\">AppUp program</a>. I got one for a while, it's really easy to port your existing Qt apps using its SDK (but that's a separate blog post).</p>\n\n<p>But that's about it. LG was supposed to showcase its <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2010/02/16/lg-gw990-to-be-among-first-meego-phones/\">MeeGo-based LG GW990</a> (based on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moorestown_(computing_platform)\">Intel Moorestown</a>). There was even rumor that LG has also a tablet product, instead of only just a smartphone. And of course Nokia has <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2011/05/17/nokia-n9-gets-teaser-video-rick-springfield-soundtrack-video/\">its own N9 phone</a> in the pipeline. None of this happened.</p>\n\n<p>When I remember back at <a href=\"http://ariya.blogspot.com/2009/09/maemo-summit-2009-amsterdam-9-11-oct.html\">Maemo Summit 2009 in Amsterdam</a>, there was an accelerated momentum just because Nokia gave <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_N900\">N900</a> to everyone. It was a top-of-the-line phone at that time, I still even use it for <a href=\"http://ariya.blogspot.com/search/label/n900\">various demos</a>. Back then I was still with Nokia and after all these years, it's not funny to see that everyone is still using it. It's fine and dandy to have millions of cars using MeeGo for its infotainment, smart TVs based on MeeGo, and so on. A refresh in this smartphone party however would have made a much more dramatic impact with respect to the momentum in the development community.</p>\n\n<p>Seems I still need to wait until I can use a MeeGo phone as my primary phone. Meanwhile, I'll stick with ExoPC tablet to learn various bits of MeeGo. And hopefully nothing would exhaust my patience.</p><div><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/17722541-8293304296204790793?l=ariya.blogspot.com\" alt=\"\"></div>"

      "content" : "<img src=\"http://planet.debian.org/heads/lucas.png\" width=\"70\" height=\"88\" alt=\"\" align=\"right\" style=\"float:right\">  <p>(this is a copy of an mail sent to ruby-core@ and ruby-talk@)</p>\n<p>Since the beginning of 2011, the Debian Ruby team has been working on several big changes. Those changes all are available in Debian unstable, some of them are also available in Debian testing, and they should all be available in the next Debian and Ubuntu releases.</p>\n<p>I think that it addresses most of the reasonable concerns about Ruby in Debian.</p>\n<h3>Using alternatives to switch between Ruby implementations</h3>\n<p>The alternatives system is now used to manage the “ruby” symlink and the other related symlinks, making it easy to switch between Ruby implementations (only Ruby 1.8 and 1.9.X at the moment) (see <a href=\"http://lists.debian.org/debian-ruby/2011/05/msg00108.html\">this mail</a> for details). The default choice for Ruby is still 1.8, but this change will make it easy for us to make a switch to 1.9.X by default (likely by the release of Debian wheezy).</p>\n<h3>Installing gems executables to /usr/local/bin</h3>\n<p>Rubygems (both as a standalone package, and as shipped with Ruby 1.9.X) now install executables to /usr/local/bin. (The other files still get installed under /var, see <a href=\"http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.ruby.general/340793\">this mail</a>)</p>\n<h3>Enabling gem update –system</h3>\n<p>gem update –system has been re-enabled. Since upgrading rubygems to a version that may not have been properly tested with the rest of the Debian system may cause issues in the user’s system, there’s a big warning about that. The user can confirm and upgrade rubygems anyway by defining an environment variable.</p>\n<h3>New gem2deb packaging helper</h3>\n<p>There’s a new packaging helper, named gem2deb, that makes it very easy to generate Debian source packages from Rubygems. We are in the process of migrating all ruby libraries packaged in Debian to that new helper. It will take some time, though (help is welcomed).</p>\n<p>Transition status: <a href=\"http://pkg-ruby-extras.alioth.debian.org/wheezy/\">http://pkg-ruby-extras.alioth.debian.org/wheezy/</a></p>\n<p>One big benefit of the switch to gem2deb for the Ruby community is that, in the process, we are enabling test suites at build time for each package and each Ruby implementation. This should make it easy to detect regressions in new interpreter versions.</p>\n<h3>Ruby 1.9.3</h3>\n<p>We will switch to Ruby 1.9.3 ASAP (probably when it is branched off trunk, with a package first in Debian experimental). Since the Ruby compatibility version issue is likely to stay around, we will re-evaluate how we are dealing with it (to avoid the ruby1.9.1 package &lt;=&gt; ruby -v = 1.9.2 problem that confuses many users). This is likely by switching the package name to ruby1.9.3 (keep a ruby1.9.1 package for compatibility). The package containing the shared library will stay libruby1.9.1.</p>\n<h3>Links</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Team website: <a href=\"http://wiki.debian.org/Teams/Ruby\">http://wiki.debian.org/Teams/Ruby</a></li>\n<li>Developer documentation about all those changes: <a href=\"http://wiki.debian.org/Teams/Ruby/RubyInWheezy\">http://wiki.debian.org/Teams/Ruby/RubyInWheezy</a></li>\n<li>contact point: debian-ruby@lists.debian.org</li>\n<li>IRC: #debian-ruby @ irc.debian.org</li>\n</ul>"

      "content" : "<p></p><p>A couple of days ago, new indenter settings were merged into the Qt Creator master repository. Below, you can find a brief description of how the indenter works and what it can do.</p>\n<h2>Global Code Style Settings</h2>\n<p>For the C++ indenter, you can now choose how to indent content (separately for classes, methods, blocks and namespaces) and how to indent braces (of classes, namespaces, enums, methods and blocks). You can have detailed control over switch statements and their contents. It is also possible to influence the behaviour of alignment for continuation lines.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://labs.qt.nokia.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/indenterGlobalCpp.png\"><img title=\"indenter Global Cpp\" src=\"http://labs.qt.nokia.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/indenterGlobalCpp.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"475\" height=\"335\"></a></p>\n<p>The new C++ indenter options can be found in the Options dialog (called Preferences on Mac OS X), under the “C++” category, in the “Code Style” tab. In addition, you can specify your own tab settings in the “General” tab, which will be applied only for the C++ editor, or you can choose to use global tab settings for C++ (the default). Change of any option is instantly reflected in a live preview, where content can be modified.</p>\n<h2>Project Code Style Settings</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://labs.qt.nokia.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/indenterProjectCpp.png\"><img title=\"Indenter Project Cpp\" src=\"http://labs.qt.nokia.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/indenterProjectCpp.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"458\" height=\"321\"></a></p>\n<p>C++ code style settings can be different for every project you are working on. The project settings overwrite global settings. However, if you are fine with your global settings, you can easily use them for your project (the default). In order to change code style settings for you project, switch to “Project” mode, select your desired project from top tab bar and select “Code Style Settings”. If you uncheck the “Use global C++ settings” checkbox, you are free to modify code style settings for your project. In addition, “General” tab contains “Settings” combobox – here you can select which tab settings should be used for C++ files in your project. You can specify your own C++ tab settings by selecting “Custom” or you can specify that tab settings should be taken from “Global text editor” settings, “Global C++” settings or from “Project text editor” settings (which can be set in “Editor Settings” in the Project mode).</p>\n<h2>Tab Settings</h2>\n<p>In addition, it’s now possible to specify tab settings separately for different languages. Currently, C++ and QML/JS are supported. Tab settings specific to the language can be set for both global and project scopes. For global level, they can be found in Options under specific language category (“C++” and “Qt Quick”, respectively). For project level, they can be found under “Code Style Settings” in the Project mode and selected in the “Language” combobox.</p>\n<p>The current solution allows you to set tab settings at 4 different levels:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Global: for all editors</li>\n<li>Global C++ / Qt Quick: for C++ / QmlJs editors</li>\n<li>Project: for all editors of files which belong to the project</li>\n<li>Project C++ / Qt Quick: for C++ / QmlJs editors of files which belong the the project</li>\n</ol>\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"http://labs.qt.nokia.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/TabSettingsFallbacks5.png\"><img title=\"TabSettingsFallbacks\" src=\"http://labs.qt.nokia.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/TabSettingsFallbacks5.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"475\" height=\"226\"></a>\n\t<p>The tab settings' fallback mechanism</p>\n</div>\n<p>The green arrows show the possible fallbacks which can be specified for tab settings from each level.</p>\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"http://labs.qt.nokia.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/TabSettingsExamples5.png\"><img title=\"TabSettingsExamples\" src=\"http://labs.qt.nokia.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/TabSettingsExamples5.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"476\" height=\"283\"></a>\n\t<p>Which tab settings will be used?</p>\n</div>\n<p>OK, so let’s say you have one project open and your tab size settings look like in the above picture. Which tab size is used in your editors? Here are a couple of examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>foo.cpp which belongs to your project: 8</li>\n<li>foo.txt which belongs to your project: 6</li>\n<li>bar.cpp which is not in your project: 4</li>\n<li>bar.txt which is not in your project: 2</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Storing Project Settings</h2>\n<p>Currently (as it was with editor settings in Qt Creator 2.2), settings are stored in .user files. However, the plan is to store them in a separate file so that they can be stored in project repositories and shared between users.</p>\n<p>Any suggestions are appreciated: <a href=\"http://bugreports.qt.nokia.com\">http://bugreports.qt.nokia.com</a></p>"

Thus your signature on a key will give other people a\nrough identity check information and no trust information at all.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, the OpenPGP standard does allow to publish precise identity\ncheck and trust information on signatures, but unfortunately this is now\nenabled with GnuPG by default. These features are called\n<em>certification level</em> and <em>trust signatures</em>.</p><h2>Certification level</h2>\n\n<p>To indicate how careful you verified someone's identity, run GnuPG\nwith the option <var>--ask-cert-level</var>, or add\n<var>ask-cert-level</var> to your configuration file\n<code>.gnupg/gpg.conf</code>.</p>\n\n<p>When you make a signature with this option, GnuPG will ask you how\ncarefully you verified the key owner's identity. According to the\nmanpage gpg(1), the available levels are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>0: no indication;</li>\n    <li>1: personal belief but no verification, useful for signing\n    pseudonymous IDs;</li>\n    <li>2: casual verification;</li>\n    <li>3: extensive verification.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Trust level</h2>\n\n<p>You can also indicate how much you trust someone, sign his key with\nthe command <code>tsign</code> instead of <code>sign</code>. GnuPG will\nthen ask you three questions:</p>\n\n<ol>\n    <li>how far you trust him to verify other people's keys: marginally\n    or fully (I personally only fully trust people that were trained or challenged by myself or by people I trust even more)</li>\n    <li>how far you allow him to make trust signatures on your behalf:\n    usually answer 1; answering 3 would allow him to issue trust\n    signature with level 2, thus allowing other people to issue trust\n    signatures on your behalf (this features exists to implement\n    pyramidal certification systems, but can be interesting for signing\n    your own keys when you have several);</li>\n    <li>if you wish to restrict this signature to a <em>domain</em>: I\n    have no idea of what this means so I give none.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>Although certification level and trust signatures are not very widely\nused, thanks to GnuPG's default settings, it allows to publish more\ninformation about your signatures, adding value to the web of trust at\nno cost, which I believe is a good think. Thus I think it is worth doing\nit.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to use these features with the\n<a href=\"http://pgp-tools.alioth.debian.org/\">caff</a> wrapper, remember\nthat it has its own GnuPG configuration\n<code>.caff/gnupghome/gpg.conf</code>. In addition it does not implement\ntrust signatures natively: to use them, you have to abort the automatic\nsigning, which gives you a GnuPG prompt, where you are then able to\n<code>tsign</code>, then exit to return to caff that will consider your\ntrust signatures.</p>\n\n<h2>Credits</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://tanguy.ortolo.eu/blog/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Muenster-100725-15996-%C3%9Cberwasserkirche-Schl%C3%BCssel.jpg\">Wikimedia Commons</a> for Saint Peter's key photograph, GFDL 1.2 licensed.</li>\n</ul>"

The name of that problem is <a href=\"http://www.nvidia.com\">NVidia</a> and their <a href=\"http://www.nvidia.com/object/optimus_technology.html\">Optimus technology</a>. The idea of that tech is quite neat – take a laptop, put two video cards in it, use the powerful card when you need 3D power, use the weak card when you need to conserve battery. The problem is that any laptop with this technology is currently an expensive paperweight on Linux (or rather it was so until a couple weeks ago, see below). And NVidia has <a href=\"http://www.nvnews.net/vbulletin/showthread.php?t=144750\">no plans for fixing that</a>.</p>\n<p>Let me explain the technicalities.</p>\n<p>In all modern laptops (such as the new and sexy <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2011/05/23/dell-xps-15z-review/\">Dell XPS 15z</a> and many, many others) NVidia Optimus is implemented as follows – there is an NVidia card and an Intel card, all display outputs are connected to the Intel card, when the user wants more 3D power, the NVidia card is powered on and it renders an image into a framebuffer in the video memory of the Intel card which is the responsible for actually outputing that framebuffer to a display.</p>\n<p>Currently in Linux if you are using NVidia drivers the Intel card is left uninitialised, your session starts up fine on the NVidia card, it outputs the resulting picture onto the video memory of the Intel card, but … the Intel card is not configured in any way and so it does not do anything further with this picture and the display stays black.</p>\n<p>The alternative is to use Intel video card driver and then the NVidia card stays there in your laptop as dead weight. It does not even power down (out of the box) so you have all the power consumption and none of the functionality. There is some support from NVidia to using that card for CUDA computing purposes in such situation, but nothing else.</p>\n<p>After years of neglect and statements from NVidia that Optimus support in Linux is impossible and thus not even planned, one individual stepped up and <a href=\"http://www.martin-juhl.dk/2011/05/optimus-on-linux-problem-solved/\">made it work</a>. Yes, the solution is hacky, yes it is a hassle to set up and make it work, but this is the first glimmer of hope for actually working Optimus on Linux. Over the last couple years the share of laptops with Optimus has greatly increased – almost all laptops that have NVidia video cards have Optimus now. This <a href=\"https://github.com/MrMEEE/bumblebee\">Bumblebee project</a> is currently our only real hope on making Linux work on these laptops.</p>\n<p>This project needs our support in a multitude of ways:<br>\n1) help test the actual project on different hardware;<br>\n2) look at the code and help improve on it, both the core code and system integration, simplify it so that everyone can install and use this;<br>\n3) figure out how we can integrate that support into distributions, so that it becomes possible to have working Linux out-of-the-box on Optimus hardware;<br>\n4) pressure NVidia more to provide official Optimus support on Linux (at least in always-on-NVidia mode, without breaking Bumblebee along the way).</p>\n<p>Martin has already showed the superiority of open source by implementing something that NVidia considered to be too hard to do, let’s show the power of our community to push such solutions to production quality.</p>"

Developers can choose to create apps for five categories: communication, games, entertainment, knowledge and tools. The best app in each category will receive a WeTab, cash and other merchandise prizes from Nokia, Qt and Intel.</p>\n<p>All the winning apps will be deployed in the WeTab Market. You will also have the possibility to deploy your application in the AppUp<sup>SM</sup> center in order to make sure that all users of the WeTab and other upcoming WeTab OS and MeeGo-based devices can download/purchase and use your app. <span></span></p>\n<p><strong>What’s the WeTab?</strong></p>\n<p><strong><img src=\"http://blog.qt.nokia.com/files/2011/05/4tiitoo-WeTab.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"496\" height=\"311\"><br>\n</strong></p>\n<p>The WeTab is the first MeeGo tablet computer on the market and unlike its tablet brothers and sisters, the WeTab offers open software and hardware. The WeTab OS based on MeeGo technology runs on an open platform where anyone can contribute.</p>\n<p>“We are 100% dedicated to MeeGo and the Qt community and that is why we decided from early on to standardize the WeTab on Qt/MeeGo. MeeGo and Qt offer an unsurpassed freedom to developers and WeTab OS strongly believes in open source. Accordingly it supports applications from multiple platforms and technologies for best and unrestricted web and computing experience. We look forward to building our WeTab Market with the stunning Qt apps we are surely going to receive from this challenge,” said Stephan Odörfer, CTO, 4tiitoo.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Important dates to remember</strong></p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Submission period: </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Start: </strong>May 23, 2011 <strong>End</strong>: July 1, 2011 (23:59 PST)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Judging period</strong>:</p>\n<p><strong>Start</strong>: July 2, 2011 <strong>End</strong>: July 10, 2011 (23:59 CET)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Public voting period:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Start</strong>: July 11, 2011 (12:00 CET) <strong>End</strong>: July, 18, 2011 (23:59 PST)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Winners announced</strong>:</p>\n<p>July 21, 2011</p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p>Learn more and take the challenge here:  <a href=\"http://wetab.mobi/app-challenge/\">wetab.mobi/app-challenge</a></p>\n<div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheQtBlog?a=oKs0qFmZrFo:hTZ_Q8NWXAQ:3QFJfmc7Om4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheQtBlog?i=oKs0qFmZrFo:hTZ_Q8NWXAQ:3QFJfmc7Om4\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheQtBlog?a=oKs0qFmZrFo:hTZ_Q8NWXAQ:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheQtBlog?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheQtBlog?a=oKs0qFmZrFo:hTZ_Q8NWXAQ:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheQtBlog?i=oKs0qFmZrFo:hTZ_Q8NWXAQ:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheQtBlog?a=oKs0qFmZrFo:hTZ_Q8NWXAQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheQtBlog?i=oKs0qFmZrFo:hTZ_Q8NWXAQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheQtBlog?a=oKs0qFmZrFo:hTZ_Q8NWXAQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheQtBlog?i=oKs0qFmZrFo:hTZ_Q8NWXAQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheQtBlog?a=oKs0qFmZrFo:hTZ_Q8NWXAQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheQtBlog?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheQtBlog?a=oKs0qFmZrFo:hTZ_Q8NWXAQ:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheQtBlog?i=oKs0qFmZrFo:hTZ_Q8NWXAQ:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheQtBlog/~4/oKs0qFmZrFo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

The purpose of this is is to have both the C++ and the Java code in same project folder (for easier handing with version control system) and to allow building the application from inside the Eclipse, without reverting to command line.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The most of the steps are the same as in the previous post about integrating NDK with Eclipse.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">First, we need to convert the project to C++ project:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>right click on project root,then select New Project -&gt; Other -&gt; C++ -&gt; Convert to C++</li>\n<li>check C++ project, choose Makefile and for toolchain choose other.</li>\n<li>accept to open the C++ perspective.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Until this, the project was converted to C++ project. We now need to set up the input and output folders for C++ build:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align:justify\">create the <span style=\"font-family:monospace\">libs</span>, <span style=\"font-family:monospace\">jni</span> and <span style=\"font-family:monospace\">obj</span> folders. Set the output folders to <span style=\"font-family:monospace\">libs</span> and <span style=\"font-family:monospace\">obj</span>, then set the source folder to <span style=\"font-family:monospace\">jni</span> (in project properties, C++ General)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And finally we need to set up a new builder:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align:justify\">while in C++ perspective, open project properties and choose builders, then uncheck everything related to CDT builder.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align:justify\">create a new builder of type program.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align:justify\">in the window with builder properties: first text field contains the ndk-build script location, second text field contains project location and the last one should contain <span style=\"font-family:monospace\">-C ${build_project}</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">And that’s it. You should be able to build your project, Clean and eclipse will run the required builders in order to build both java and C++ code and finally create the APK file.<br>\nBefore first build it is possible there will be some errors, but those will disappear after the build.</p>"

Harold had previously done this in 1994 so he’s got form for predictions that don’t come true.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.skepticsannotatedbible.com/1th/5.html\">The bible says that “the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night” [2]</a>, so obviously Jesus can’t return on a day when billboards all around the world are predicting him! Maybe rather than being wrong, Harold has in fact prevented the end of the world by predicting it correctly!</p>\n<p>Now if a church like Harold’s can make predictions separated by slightly less than 17 years (let’s round it off to 6000 days) then we only need 6000 such churches scheduled to predict different days to cause the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapture\">rapture</a> to be indefinitely deferred. If the churches were to predict which week the world would end then we would only need something less than 900 such churches – or maybe 1800 so we have redundancy.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://community.history.com/topic/40022/t/Harold-Camping-Earns-70million-Misleading-Religious-Flock.html\">It seems that Harold Camping makes his money by scaring gullible people into selling everything they own and giving the money to him [3]</a>. If we are to achieve the goal of having someone forecast the end of the world every day then it would be good if such people were forced to raise money more often than every 17 years. A good solution to this might be a tax on “end of days” religious investments, money that was given to a religious corporation or sole trader following a scare about the end of the world could be subject to a 100% tax rate if not spent within 1 year. Then Harold would be forced to make a prediction for every year and thus give us greater protection from the end of the world.</p>\n<h3>&lt;/Satire&gt;</h3>\n<p>But seriously we need to tax religious organisations in the same way as other companies. A religious organisation that gives money to help the needy can use that as a tax deduction, and operating expenses such as paying salaries of staff are also tax deductable. So the serious religious groups would have a tax rate that is fairly close to zero anyway. When a religious leader wants to have 27 Rolls Royces they should be forced to pay tax on all that money, and additionally they should be compelled to publish a statement of company accounts for everyone who gave money – just as corporations are compelled to provide information to stock-holders.</p>\n<p>Currently various religious organisations are denouncing Harold and his followers to try and save Christianity from ridicule (<a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/2011/05/20/2011-05-20_end_of_days_not_coming_on_may_21_author_steve_wohlberg_says_but_were_heading_tow.html\">here’s one example [4]</a>). It seems to me that if they want to avoid ridicule they should advocate that religious organisations be forced to open their books and pay tax on their profits so that people like Harold can’t use religion as a money-making scam.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>[1]<a href=\"http://www.slate.com/id/2295122/\"> http://www.slate.com/id/2295122/</a></li>\n<li>[2]<a href=\"http://www.skepticsannotatedbible.com/1th/5.html\"> http://www.skepticsannotatedbible.com/1th/5.html</a></li>\n<li>[3]<a href=\"http://community.history.com/topic/40022/t/Harold-Camping-Earns-70million-Misleading-Religious-Flock.html\"> http://community.history.com/topic/40022/t/Harold-Camping-Earns-70million-Misleading-Religious-Flock.html</a></li>\n<li>[4]<a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/2011/05/20/2011-05-20_end_of_days_not_coming_on_may_21_author_steve_wohlberg_says_but_were_heading_tow.html\"> http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/2011/05/20/2011-05-20_end_of_days_not_coming_on_may_21_author_steve_wohlberg_says_but_were_heading_tow.html</a></li>\n</ul>"

I’ve done this many times and have written about it before (e.g., see <a href=\"http://josefsson.org/openwrt/\">my OpenWRT writeup page</a>) but I recently did it with modern hardware again.  Here I will use the <a href=\"http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr1043nd\">TP-Link TL-WR1043ND</a> wireless router (available here for around $50) together with the Huawei E367 3G UMTS/HSDPA modem.

      "content" : "<p>As I promised at RailsConf, we’re finally good to go on the Rails 3.1: Release Candidate. This is a fantastically exciting release. We have three new star features and an even greater number of just awesome improvements. First the stars:</p>\n\n\n\t<p><b>The Asset Pipeline</b><br>\nThe star feature of 3.1 is the asset pipeline powered by <a href=\"https://github.com/sstephenson/sprockets/\">Sprockets 2.0</a>. It makes <span>CSS</span> and JavaScript first-class code citizens and enables proper organization, including use in plugins and engines. See <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGdCI2HhfAU\">my RailsConf keynote</a> for a full tour. This comes with <a href=\"http://sass-lang.com/\"><span>SCSS</span></a> as the default for stylesheets and <a href=\"http://coffeescript.org/\">CoffeeScript</a> as the default for JavaScript. Much documentation is on the way for this.</p>\n\n\n\t<p><b><span>HTTP</span> Streaming</b><br>\nThis lets the browser download your stylesheet and javascripts while the server is still generating the response. The result is noticeable faster pages. It’s opt-in and does require support from the web server as well, but the popular combo of nginx and unicorn is ready to take advantage of it. There’s a great <a href=\"http://railscasts.com/episodes/266-http-streaming\">Railscast on <span>HTTP</span> streaming</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/actionpack/lib/action_controller/metal/streaming.rb\">the <span>API</span> documentation</a> is strong too.</p>\n\n\n\t<p><b>jQuery is now the default</b><br>\nWe’ve made <a href=\"http://jquery.com/\">jQuery</a> the default JavaScript framework that ships with Rails, but it’s silly easy to switch back to Prototype if you fancy. It’s all bundled up in the jquery-rails and prototype-rails gems. Just depend on the one you’d like in the Gemfile and it’ll Just Work.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Other good stuff:</p>\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"http://edgerails.info/articles/what-s-new-in-edge-rails/2011/05/06/reversible-migrations/index.html\">Reversible migrations</a>: <span>DRY</span> migrations that know how to revert themselves. Cleaner, nicer migrations.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/railties/lib/rails/engine.rb\">Mountable engines</a>: Engines can now have their own routing and helper scope. They can also take advantage of the asset pipeline (more documentation on this soon). Read <a href=\"http://piotrsarnacki.com/2010/09/14/mountable-engines/\">the story behind mountable engines</a> (even if the asset stuff is now out of date).</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://edgerails.info/articles/what-s-new-in-edge-rails/2011/04/21/activerecord-identity-map/index.html\">Identity Map</a>: It’s not enabled by default because of some <a href=\"https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/activerecord/lib/active_record/identity_map.rb\">important caveats</a> that are still to be ironed out, but if you can deal with those, it’s a great way to cut down on the number of queries your app will trigger. Faster is better!</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWOAHIpmLAI&amp;t=9m28s\">Prepared statements</a>: Active Record now uses cached prepared statements, which is a big boost for PostgreSQL in all cases and a boost for MySQL on complex statements.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://rtomayko.github.com/rack-cache/\">Rack::Cache on by default</a>: This makes it possible to use <span>HTTP</span> caching with <a href=\"https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/actionpack/lib/action_controller/metal/conditional_get.rb\">conditional get</a> as a replacement for page caching (which we’ll soon factor into a plugin and remove from core).</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/TwP/turn\">Turn test-output on Ruby 1.9</a>: Much nicer test output courtesy of the Turn gem. It’s on with new applications by default on Ruby 1.9.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/actionpack/lib/action_controller/metal/force_ssl.rb\">Force <span>SSL</span></a>: It’s now easier than ever to keep your app safe with force_ssl. Either per-app or per-controller.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/activerecord/test/cases/mass_assignment_security_test.rb\">Role-based mass-assignment protection</a>: attr_protected now accepts roles, so it’s easier do deal with admin/non-admin splits and more.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/activemodel/lib/active_model/secure_password.rb\">has_secure_password</a>: Dead-simple BCrypt-based passwords. Now there’s no excuse not to roll your own authentication scheme.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://edgerails.info/articles/what-s-new-in-edge-rails/2011/03/09/custom-activerecord-attribute-serialization/index.html\">Custom serializers</a>: Serialize objects with <span>JSON</span> or whatever else you’d like.</li></ul>\n\n\t<p>You can also check out the <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/958283\">an even longer changelog</a> and get <a href=\"http://railscasts.com/episodes/265-rails-3-1-overview\">a video overview from Railscast</a>.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>If you’re starting a new application, it’s strongly recommended that you do so using Ruby 1.9.2. Rails will continue to support 1.8.x until Rails 4.0, but it’s considered the legacy option. Ruby 1.9.x is where the action is. Get on board and enjoy the massive speed boost.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>You can install the Rails 3.1: Release Candidate with <code>gem install rails --pre</code>. Enjoy and <a href=\"https://github.com/rails/rails/issues?milestone=&amp;sort=created&amp;direction=desc&amp;labels=&amp;state=open\">report any release candidate issues on Github</a>. We expect to release the final version in a couple of weeks if all goes well.</p>"

You can\nfor example use <a href=\"http://www.gns3.net/\"><span>GNS3</span></a>, <a href=\"http://www.netkit.org\">Netkit</a>, <a href=\"http://www.marionnet.org/\">Marionnet</a>\nor <a href=\"http://www.dit.upm.es/vnumlwiki/index.php/Main_Page\"><span>VNUML</span></a>. Some of those tools, like <a href=\"http://www.gns3.net/\"><span>GNS3</span></a>, allow to\nadd some closed source equipments like a Cisco 7200 or a Juniper router.</p>\n<p>All those tools are a great way to setup your network lab. <em>Look at\nthem!</em> If you want to setup a virtual network lab for educational\npurpose, one of those should fit your purpose. However, none of those\nsolution were a perfect match for me. I did not want to maintain some\nroot filesystem. I wanted my lab to start in a few seconds. I wanted\nto keep all configuration files (including the ones for the virtual\nhosts) into one subdirectory of my home and be able to modify them\nwhile the lab was running. I also wanted to be able to plug some Cisco\nrouter using <a href=\"http://www.dynagen.org/\">Dynamips/Dynagen</a>.</p>\n<p>None of the listed solution above matched all those\ncriteria. Therefore, I setup my own lab script with\n<a href=\"http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/\">User Mode Linux</a>. This is not a complete solution, but is more\nlike a home-made solution to match one particular need. You cannot use\nthe final result without tweaking it. Again, look at the other\nsolutions first.</p>\n<p>We will go step by step to understand how the lab was built. If you\nare in a hurry, you can look at the result which is published on\n<a href=\"https://github.com/vincentbernat/network-lab/tree/master/lab-redundant-vpn\">GitHub</a>.</p>\n<h1>User Mode Linux</h1>\n<p><a href=\"http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/\">User Mode Linux</a> (or <abbr title=\"User Mode Linux\"><span>UML</span></abbr>) is a Linux kernel running as a process\ninstead of running on top of some processor. With Debian, you can\ninstall it using <code>apt-get install user-mode-linux</code>. You get a <code>linux</code>\ncommand that will run your Linux kernel as a simple process.

We also turn <code>/var/run</code> and\n<code>/var/log</code> as <code>tmpfs</code> filesystems. This will allow most daemons to run\ncorrectly: they will be able to write runtime data in <code>/var/run</code> and\nto write logs in <code>/var/log</code>. You can even launch your favorite syslog daemon.</p>\n<p>The line about <code>/lib/modules</code> is to ensure that our <abbr title=\"User Mode Linux\"><span>UML</span></abbr> kernel is able\nto access its kernel modules. For example, we can now use\n<code>modprobe tun</code>. The line about <code>/home</code> allows to mount the home\ndirectory of your host inside <abbr title=\"User Mode Linux\"><span>UML</span></abbr>. This was already the case, but\nit was mounted as read-only.</p>\n<p>One important thing to notice is that while you seem to be root inside\n<abbr title=\"User Mode Linux\"><span>UML</span></abbr>, you did not run <code>linux</code> as root. Therefore, when the <abbr title=\"User Mode Linux\"><span>UML</span></abbr> kernel\ntries to write a file it will still be bound by the permissions\ngranted by your host kernel. See this example:</p>\n<table><tbody><tr><td><div><pre>1\n2\n3\n4</pre></div></td><td><div><pre><span>#</span> mount -o remount,rw /\n<span>#</span> touch /tmp/test1\n<span>#</span> touch /etc/test1\n<span>touch: cannot touch `/etc/test1': Permission denied</span>\n</pre></div>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n<p>This is a great way to ensure that your lab will not destroy your\nhost. Do not run <code>linux</code> as root.</p>\n<p>What is interesting with such a setup is that you share the filesystem\nwith your host. You can modify some configuration file on your host\nand your <abbr title=\"User Mode Linux\"><span>UML</span></abbr> will see the modification right away. You can also modify\na file inside <abbr title=\"User Mode Linux\"><span>UML</span></abbr> and see the modification on your host too.</p>\n<h2>Console <span>&amp;</span> job control</h2>\n<p>There is a slight problem with this environment. You may be used to it\nif you already started your own <span>GNU</span>/Linux system with\n<code>init=/bin/sh</code>. The problem is that you don’t have job control. Job\ncontrol allows you to put tasks in background and interrupt them while\nthey are running. It is job control that allows you to stop a program\nwith <code>^C</code>. Here, you don’t have job control. See:</p>\n<table><tbody><tr><td><div><pre>1\n2</pre></div></td><td><div><pre><span>#</span> cat\n<span>^C^C^C^C</span>\n</pre></div>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n<p>You are stuck. The only way to go out is to kill the <code>linux</code> process\non your host.</p>\n<p>Job control is a great mystery for me. I don’t know how to enable it\nby hand. However, <code>getty</code> is able to enable job control for you. Just\ntype this command:</p>\n<table><tbody><tr><td><div><pre>1</pre></div></td><td><div><pre><span>#</span> <span>exec </span>getty -n -l /bin/sh 38400 /dev/tty0\n</pre></div>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n<p>You get job control. We keep <code>/bin/sh</code>, but you may prefer <code>/bin/bash</code>\nsince on most systems, <code>/bin/sh</code> is rather basic.</p>\n<h2>Writable root filesystem</h2>\n<p>Let’s get back to our root filesystem. Most daemons can run just fine\nwith our setup. For example, we can start <a href=\"http://wiki.nginx.org\">Nginx</a>, a popular\nweb server:</p>\n<table><tbody><tr><td><div><pre>1\n2\n3</pre></div></td><td><div><pre><span>#</span> mkdir /var/log/nginx\n<span>#</span> /etc/init.d/nginx start\n<span>Starting nginx: nginx.</span>\n</pre></div>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n<p>However, it will use the configuration file in\n<code>/etc/nginx</code>. You don’t want to modify this directory for all your\nlabs. The best way to handle this is to start Nginx with a custom\nconfiguration file:</p>\n<table><tbody><tr><td><div><pre>1\n2</pre></div></td><td><div><pre><span>#</span> /etc/init.d/nginx stop\n<span>#</span> nginx -c /home/bernat/mylab/nginx.conf\n</pre></div>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n<p>While keeping the configuration files related to your lab in your home\nis an important objective (all your lab related files are in the same\nplace and you can modify them at will), it may be more convenient to\nstill use <code>/etc/init.d/nginx</code> script to control Nginx. Moreover, some\ndaemons do not allow to specify a configuration file. You will then\nneed to modify your root filesystem.</p>\n<p>This is a pretty common problem with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_CD\">Live <span>CD</span></a> and it is\nsolved by using an union mount. This is a special kind of mount that\nwill merge two filesystems into one. One of the two filesystems can be\nread-only and all the changes will be reported to the second\none. We will use <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aufs\"><span>AUFS</span></a>. Ensure that you have <code>aufs-tools</code>\npackage installed. Let’s start from scratch for this example.</p>\n<table><tbody><tr><td><div><pre> 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10</pre></div></td><td><div><pre><span>$</span> linux <span>init</span><span>=</span>/bin/sh <span>rootfstype</span><span>=</span>hostfs\n<span>[...]</span>\n<span>#</span> mount -n -t proc proc /proc\n<span>#</span> mount -n -t sysfs sysfs /sys\n<span>#</span> mount -o <span>bind</span> /usr/lib/uml/modules /lib/modules\n<span>#</span> mount -n -t tmpfs tmpfs /tmp -o rw,nosuid,nodev\n<span>#</span> mkdir /tmp/ro /tmp/rw /tmp/aufs\n<span>#</span> mount -n -t hostfs hostfs /tmp/ro -o /,ro\n<span>#</span> mount -n -t aufs aufs /tmp/aufs -o noatime,dirs<span>=</span>/tmp/rw:/tmp/ro<span>=</span>ro\n<span>#</span> <span>exec </span>chroot /tmp/aufs /bin/bash\n</pre></div>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n<p>It seems that <span>AUFS</span> with hostfs is rather fragile. We could have merged\nour root filesystem with some directory in our lab using <code>hostfs</code> like this:</p>\n<table><tbody><tr><td><div><pre>1\n2\n3\n4</pre></div></td><td><div><pre><span>#</span> mount -n -t hostfs hostfs /tmp/rw -o /home/bernat/mylab/root,rw\n<span>#</span> mount -n -t hostfs hostfs /tmp/ro -o /,ro\n<span>#</span> mount -n -t aufs aufs /tmp/aufs -o noatime,dirs<span>=</span>/tmp/rw:/tmp/ro<span>=</span>ro\n<span>#</span> <span>exec </span>chroot /tmp/aufs /bin/bash\n</pre></div>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n<p>However, the kernel panics on most operations. Therefore, <code>/tmp/rw</code> stays\nin a <code>tmpfs</code> filesystem. This means that any change to the root\nfilesystem will be lost. I also was unable to issue a correct\n<code>pivot_root</code> before <code>chroot</code>. This is not really important here.</p>\n<p><strong><span>UPDATED</span>:</strong> It seems that there are other drawbacks to this\nsetup. For some reason, if you have a separate <code>/usr</code> partition on\nyour host system, you won’t be able to write to it until you specify\nthe <code>noxino</code> option to <span>AUFS</span>. Another issue is that <span>AUFS</span> does not\nnotice most changes on the hostfs filesystem. You can fix this with\noption <code>udba=inotify</code>. However, this is incompatible with the <code>noxino</code>\noption. Therefore, you need to choose what is best for your\nlab. You can also mount some parts of your home with <code>hostfs</code> (for\nexample, the source directory of the piece of software that you would\nlike to test).</p>\n<p>Let’s consider that Nginx configuration is in\n<code>/home/bernat/lab/nginx</code>. We simply uses a symbolic link:</p>\n<table><tbody><tr><td><div><pre>1\n2</pre></div></td><td><div><pre><span>#</span> rm -rf /etc/nginx\n<span>#</span> ln -s /home/bernat/mylab/nginx /etc/nginx\n</pre></div>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n<p>Since we lose the modifications to the root filesystem, the symbolic\nlink should be done each time we start the lab. However, we can modify\ndirectly the configuration files in the host or in the <abbr title=\"User Mode Linux\"><span>UML</span></abbr>.</p>\n<h1>Networking</h1>\n<p>We know how to start our <abbr title=\"User Mode Linux\"><span>UML</span></abbr>. Let’s see how we can add some wires to\nit. <abbr title=\"User Mode Linux\"><span>UML</span></abbr> supports several network adapters. The two most useful are <span>TAP</span>\nand <abbr title=\"Virtual Distributed Ethernet\"><span>VDE</span></abbr> backend.</p>\n<h2><span>TAP</span></h2>\n<p>A <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TUN/TAP\"><span>TAP</span> interface</a> is a virtual network kernel device which can be\nused by userland applications to inject layer 2 frames in\nit. If the kernel sends frames in a <span>TAP</span> device, they will be received\nby the application listening to it. This also works the other way\naround. A <span>TAP</span> interface is a regular ethernet device for the\nkernel. This means that you can bridge it or use <code>tcpdump</code> on it.</p>\n<p>The drawback of such interfaces is that you need to be root to create\nthem. The application using them does not need to be run as root.</p>\n<p>I usually use this nifty shell function to setup <span>TAP</span> interfaces:</p>\n<table><tbody><tr><td><div><pre> 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23</pre></div></td><td><div><pre>__add_to_bridge<span>()</span> <span>{</span>\n    <span># Optionally, add it to given bridge</span>\n    <span>[</span> -z <span>\"$2\"</span> <span>]</span> <span>||</span> <span>{</span>\n        <span>[</span> -f /sys/class/net/<span>$2</span>/brforward <span>]</span> <span>||</span> <span>{</span>\n            sudo brctl addbr <span>$2</span>\n            sudo brctl stp <span>$2</span> off\n            sudo ip link <span>set</span> <span>$2</span> up\n        <span>}</span>\n        <span>[</span> -f /sys/class/net/<span>$2</span>/brif/<span>$1</span> <span>]</span> <span>||</span> <span>{</span>\n            <span># We need to check if it is in another bridge</span>\n            <span>bridge</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span><span>echo</span> /sys/class/net/*/brif/<span>$1</span> 2&gt; /dev/null | <span>\\</span>\n                sed <span>'s+/sys/class/net/\\([^/]*\\)/.*+\\1+'</span><span>)</span> 2&gt; /dev/null\n            <span>[</span> -n <span>\"$bridge\"</span> <span>]</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>\\</span>\n                sudo brctl delif <span>$bridge</span> <span>$1</span>\n            sudo brctl addif <span>$2</span> <span>$1</span>\n        <span>}</span>\n    <span>}</span>\n<span>}</span>\ntap<span>()</span> <span>{</span>\n    sudo tunctl -b -u <span>$(</span>whoami<span>)</span> -t <span>$1</span> &gt; /dev/null\n    sudo ip link <span>set </span>up dev <span>$1</span>\n    __add_to_bridge <span>$1</span> <span>$2</span>\n<span>}</span>\n</pre></div>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n<p>It will create the interface and put it into a bridge.

Please, note that it depends on the configuration\nof your environment. However, the whole lab is contained in a single\ndirectory and is very small. You can email it to your friends or\npublish it on <a href=\"https://github.com/vincentbernat/network-lab/tree/master/lab-redundant-vpn\">GitHub</a>.</p>\n<p>It can also be extended to support <a href=\"http://www.dynagen.org/\">Dynagen</a> to include some\nCisco equipments in your lab (for example, to experiment with <abbr title=\"Virtual Routing and Forwarding\"><span>VRF</span></abbr> or\n<abbr title=\"Multiprotocol Label Switching\"><span>MPLS</span></abbr>).</p>"

      "content" : "<p>I just read <a href=\"http://rusty.ozlabs.org/?p=196\">Rusty Russell’s recent blog post about code written by assholes</a> and <a href=\"http://www.jacobian.org/writing/assholes/\">Jacob Kaplan-Moss’s response</a>.  I’ll summarize Rusty’s point as “You don’t have to like assholes or agree with them, you just have to work with them in open source,” and Jacob’s point as, “No, I don’t have to work with assholes, and if we all worked together we could make it unacceptable to be an asshole in open source.” (<a href=\"http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2564543\">Hacker News discussion here.</a>)</p>\n<p>At one time, I fully subscribed to the dogma that the only way to create high-quality, well-designed, reliable systems code (open source or not) was to be assholes to each other.  But I’ve come to disagree with past-Valerie about the necessity of assholes for a number of reasons, starting with existence proofs to the contrary: successful well-designed projects run by non-assholes like Python and Perl.</p>\n<p>Take just one argument for the necessity of assholes: <strong>Public humiliation is required for high-quality code.</strong> If you will be publicly mocked and humiliated for posting bad code, you’ll work harder on finding and fixing your bugs, and the overall code quality will go up.  Sure, fear makes you review your code more – but is this the best way to create high-quality code overall?  Are the costs higher than the benefits?</p>\n<p>Research has shown over and over again that people experiencing fear are less creative in problem solving and less likely to find the optimum solution.  <strong>Fear makes you more careful in your work, but it also makes you less willing to take risks, try new ideas, and make progress.</strong>  Fear might be a good way to run a maintenance-mode project, but not one that needs active development and new ideas.</p>\n<p>The more I look at the arguments for why assholes are necessary to good code, the more I have to wonder if some form of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome\">Stockholm syndrome</a> is at work.  As open source developers, our careers are to some degree hostage to project leaders.  If project XYZ has an abusive leader, you either have to keep working on that project with that leader, or make a significant and risky career change.  Change the leader or their behavior?  Not really an option.  There’s no manager or HR department to go to to deal with abusive fellow “employees” in open source, and it’s hard to move to a project far enough away not to work with that person but still be in your area of expertise.  It’s a tough choice.</p>\n<p>What I do know is that a lot of open source developers in asshole-heavy projects are unhappy with the current situation.  Is it possible to change the social norms of these open source projects without lowering code quality?  My guess is that the answer is yes, but only time will tell.</p>\n<p><strong>Update</strong>: People keep recommending “<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Asshole-Rule-Civilized-Workplace-ebook/dp/B000OT8GV2/\">The No Asshole Rule: Building a Civilized Workplace and Surviving One That Isn’t</a>” by Robert Sutton.  I haven’t read it, but it sounds promising enough that I bought a copy and will read it this weekend.</p>\n<br> Tagged: <a href=\"http://blog.valerieaurora.org/tag/kernel/\">kernel</a>, <a href=\"http://blog.valerieaurora.org/tag/linux/\">linux</a> <a href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/valerieaurora.wordpress.com/516/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/valerieaurora.wordpress.com/516/\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/valerieaurora.wordpress.com/516/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/delicious/valerieaurora.wordpress.com/516/\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gofacebook/valerieaurora.wordpress.com/516/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/facebook/valerieaurora.wordpress.com/516/\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gotwitter/valerieaurora.wordpress.com/516/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/twitter/valerieaurora.wordpress.com/516/\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/valerieaurora.wordpress.com/516/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/stumble/valerieaurora.wordpress.com/516/\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/valerieaurora.wordpress.com/516/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/digg/valerieaurora.wordpress.com/516/\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/valerieaurora.wordpress.com/516/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/reddit/valerieaurora.wordpress.com/516/\"></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=blog.valerieaurora.org&amp;blog=10337555&amp;post=516&amp;subd=valerieaurora&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1\" width=\"1\">"

Three days ago I stumbled upon a problem in our build process on <font style=\"font-weight:bold\">Ubuntu Natty</font>. Several modules like <font style=\"font-weight:bold\">zlib</font> weren't available. It took me a while to figure out the problem. Python's setup.py simply couldn't find <span style=\"font-family:courier new\">libz.so</span> in it's usual search paths like <span style=\"font-family:courier new\">/usr/lib</span>.<br><br>Natty has introduced a new feature called multiarch. Some shared libraries are installed in architecture specific directories, e.g. <span style=\"font-family:courier new\">/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libz.so</span> instead of <span style=\"font-family:courier new\">/usr/lib/libz.so</span>. The dynamic linker ld.so has been modified to look for libraries in the new locations. If you wonder how, <span style=\"font-family:courier new\">/etc/ld.so.conf.d/x86_64-linux-gnu.conf</span> does the trick. However Python's setup.py uses hard coded paths and doesn't know about the new feature. Barry's posting [1] has some insight information.<br><br>The problem has been dealt with for Python 2.7, 3.1, 3.2 and newer versions, but 2.6 and earlier won't see any fixes. Current Python releases (2.7.1, 3.2.0) suffer from the issue, too. Don't be battle-weary! The solution to the issue is rather simple.<br><pre><br>   $ make distclean<br>   $ export LDFLAGS=\"-L/usr/lib/$(dpkg-architecture -qDEB_HOST_MULTIARCH)\"<br>   $ ./configure<br>   $ make<br>   $ make install<br>   $ unset LDFLAGS<br></pre><br>This adds an additional library search path <span style=\"font-family:courier new\">(-L/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu</span> on my box). Now setup.py knows about the multiarch lib directory and builds zlib and all the other missing modules just fine.<br><br>Actually my build system a bit more paranoid. It also adds <span style=\"font-family:courier new\">/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu</span> as library search path and<span style=\"font-family:courier new\"> /usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu</span> as header include path for C and C++.<br><pre><br>   $ export arch=$(dpkg-architecture -qDEB_HOST_MULTIARCH)<br>   $ export LDFLAGS=\"-L/usr/lib/$arch -L/lib/$arch\"<br>   $ export CFLAGS=\"-I/usr/include/$arch\"<br>   $ export CPPFLAGS=\"-I/usr/include/$arch\"<br>   $ ./configure<br>   $ make<br>   $ make install<br>   $ unset arch LDFLAGS CFLAGS CPPFLAGS<br></pre><br>[1] <a href=\"https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2011-April/033049.html\">https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2011-April/033049.html</a>"

Qt3D started out as a Qt research project to bring Qt convenience and portability to OpenGL code, back in 2008/2009 – and it more than delivered on that promise with several of its classes finding their way into Qt’s OpenGL API.</p>\n<p>But Qt is all about Qt Quick now, which those of you who have seen our <a href=\"http://labs.qt.nokia.com/2010/08/10/qml3d-demo/\">QML 3D demo</a> will know Qt Quick has changed the Qt3D project from a set of handy C++ API’s to an amazing 3D scripting environment.  I spoke about Qt3D and also about our QML bindings at Dev Days last year and the response was huge.  We also got the message from many of you that it was less exciting to have Qt style portability for OpenGL, now that OpenGL ES 2 was becoming a de-facto standard.  This made the transition to Qt Quick for our front end even more important.</p>\n<p>So we turned the corner and now I’d like to share with you our latest work: <strong>Qt Quick 3D!</strong> We have spent the last few months debugging, improving and packaging so that we could share with you.  With Qt Quick 3D you have under the hood Qt3D with the power of C++ implemented 3D scene graphs, 3D asset loading (.3ds and other popular formats) but the developer API is all QML.</p>\n<p>What can you do with Qt Quick 3D right now?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create a QML application that features 3D content</li>\n<li>Load models made in 3D studio max or Blender into your app</li>\n<li>Add stock shapes such as cylinders and cubes</li>\n<li>Insert inline shader code into the QML to create neat effects</li>\n<li>Animate your scene with geometric animations such as rotate, translate and scale</li>\n<li>Control your scenes with QML states, transitions and animations</li>\n<li>Write app logic in javascript, and use Qt Quick 2D alongside your 3D content</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n<p>Of course we could not put everything we wanted in, so we have plenty to work on – maybe you have some special requests?  What is coming in the future:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Support for next version of QML (this will likely be the first cab off the rank).</li>\n<li>Network awareness (at present URL’s must be local file system only)</li>\n<li>Qt Creator integration for the model loader (to make it easier to position your 3D asset into your Qt Quick 3D scene)</li>\n<li>More sophisticated animations – skinning and morphing</li>\n<li>Physics engine integration</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The packaging and Qt Quick integration is still in development, but we are coming to you with this now in the hopes that we get some useful feedback on the packages themselves, and also the functionality of Qt Quick 3D so that we can improve it.  Working with packages has been a new challenge for the Qt3D team, since we have had to turn our hand from coding C++ and QML bindings to battling with the debian packaging system, Symbian .sis format and the intricacies of Windows and other desktop installers.  The bugs we know about are listed on <a href=\"http://bugreports.qt.nokia.com/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?mode=hide&amp;requestId=10286\">our public bug-tracker</a>, which is also the right place to report any new issues or to vote up the ones you’d like fixed first.</p>\n<p>Without further ado, here are the downloads:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"ftp://ftp.qt.nokia.com/qt3d/maemo5/current/\">Maemo 5 – N900</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"ftp://ftp.qt.nokia.com/qt3d/symbian%5E3/current/\">Symbian – N8</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"ftp://ftp.qt.nokia.com/qt3d/win/current/\">Win 7 – msvc (for Qt 4.7.3 msvc)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"ftp://ftp.qt.nokia.com/qt3d/noarch/current/\">Linux/Max (source package)</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>For the source package, step-by-step building instructions for Qt Creator (including screenshots) are available on our <a href=\"http://doc.qt.nokia.com/qt-quick3d-snapshot/qt3d-building.html\">Qt Quick 3D documentation page</a>.</p>\n<p>If you want to start working with Qt Quick 3D, give us feedback or get assistance, join the community on our <a href=\"http://lists.qt.nokia.com/mailman/listinfo/qt-3d\">qt-3d@nokia.com mailing list</a>.</p>"

It can be\nused by several programs, for instance by the mail server to determine what it\nshould use as its HELO name.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, the host name has two forms: the short one and the fully qualified\none. For instance, a host can have <var>muscadet</var> as its short name\n<var>muscadet</var> and <var>muscadet.example.com</var> as its fully qualified\none. From these two forms, a third information can be deduced: the domain name,\nwhich is the full name without its first component.</p>\n\n<p>The system host name can be set as either the short name or the fully\nqualified name. When the full name is used, the short one can be easily\ndeduced, by keeping only its first component. When the short name is used, the\nfull name must be determined by using a more complex heuristic that takes more\ntime and can fail for several reasons.</p><h2>Determining the short and the fully qualified host name</h2>\n\n<p>The command <code>hostname(1)</code> is able to give both the short and the\nfull host name, and also the domain name that can be deduced from them:</p>\n<dl>\n    <dt>-s, --short</dt>\n    <dd>Display the short host name. This is the host name cut at the first dot.</dd>\n    <dt>-f, --fqdn, --long</dt>\n    <dd>Display the FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name). A FQDN consists of a\n        short  host  name  and  the  DNS domain  name.</dd>\n    <dt>-d, --domain</dt>\n    <dd>Display the name of the DNS domain.</dd>\n</dl>\n\n<p>Now, given that the kernel only maintains a single host name, this command\nand the corresponding functions are using heuristics to determine these two\nforms. I did not look to the code, but here is what I have deduced:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>if you have set your system host name to the fully qualified one,\n        it deduces the short one by taking only its first component;</li>\n    <li>if you have set your system host name to the short one, it deduces\n        the full one by resolving it to an IP address, then resolving it\n        back to a host name: this may use <code>/etc/hosts</code>, the DNS\n        or a more exotic name system depending on your configuration.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The second option, when the kernel only knows the short host name, seems\nrather inferior, as it uses a more complex algorithm which takes more time (if\nit uses the DNS, it can use <em>much</em> more time than a fully local query)\nand can fail for several reasons.</p>\n\n<h2>Setting the host name</h2>\n\n<p>With Debian, the host name is stored in the file <code>/etc/hostname</code>\nand set at boot time by the <code>hostname.sh</code> init script. The local\nhosts table <code>/etc/hosts</code> also contains it, in both forms, for a\nloopback IPv4 address 127.0.1.1. It is asked at installation time: the most\ncommon practice is to give the short host name; you are then asked for the\ndomain name. But you have the option to give the fully qualified domain name,\nwhich has the effect to skip the domain name question.</p>\n\n<h2>Using a fully qualified system host name</h2>\n\n<p>I used to define short system host names, and I switched to fully qualified\nones about a year ago. I saw no drawback, but I did see benefits. Postfix, by\ndefault, uses the system host name to determine its variables\n<code>myhostname</code> and <code>mydomain</code> that are used for stuff like\nthe HELO name and the mail domain name. Well, with a short system host name, it\nfails, and you get default <code>myhostname = muscadet.localdomain</code> and\n<code>mydomain = localdomain</code>, so you have to set them explicitly in its\nconfiguration file, thus duplicating information. Whereas with a fully\nqualified system host name, it just works, and you can rely on the default\nvalues, that will stay in sync if you have to change you host name.</p>\n\n<p>To sum up, it is perfectly possible to use a fully qualified name as the\nsystem host name, even though it does not seem to be a common practice. In\nfact, according to my experience, it is even advisable, as it eases the\nconfiguration of programs that rely on the host name, such as mail servers.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong> As noticed by Javi, the <code>hostname(1)</code> manpage ends by saying without explaination that <code>/etc/hostname</code> should contain the short host name and not the full one. There may by some drawbacks by doing so but I was not able not identify them.</p>"

I think good mailing list software is better because:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\nList members can help themselves – they can subscribe, unsubscribe and set options by sending email to the software or visiting its website, which reduces the worker time required to manage the list. But you can still manage it directly if you prefer.\n</li>\n<li>\nYour address book is smaller – because you don’t need every address on the mailing list cluttering up your email software’s address book any more\n</li>\n<li>\nErrors are handled automatically – if an address doesn’t work any more, the software will unsubscribe it, usually with some safeguards against one-off problems\n</li>\n<li>\nPrivacy is safeguarded – dedicated email list software will not put all the mailing list addresses in the To-line by mistake (as often happens with Address Book announcement lists)\n</li>\n<li>\nSpam is filtered – rules can be set centrally and they can be different to the rest of your organisation\n</li>\n<li>\nMessages can be moderated – if needed, the list managers can be asked to pre-approve the messages, or you can set rules to allow some automatically.\n</li>\n<li>\nEmails can be archived – most list software can save copies of messages for you, or put them on the web\n</li>\n<li>\nYou can offer digests – offer members the choice between getting every message or daily or weekly batches\n</li>\n<li>\nMultiple versions can be sent – some list software can send different versions of the same email (like rich and plain text, or different languages) as chosen by the user\n</li>\n<li>\nYou can syndicate news – some list software can also put your announcements on content management systems or social media\n</li>\n<li>\n(OK, I’ve done 10… there are two more which matter to a <a href=\"http://www.news.software.coop/categories/tech/\" title=\"tech\">tech</a> worker like me which I’m going to mention as free extras.) It’s more efficient – most list software is designed to handle hundreds or thousands of recipients and sends email with more robust settings than a typical desktop email client. It is less likely to fail after recipient 373 and ask you to resend them all.\n</li>\n<li>\nComply with standards – good list software either follows standards for things like self-service and digests automatically or can be told to do it. Some desktop email software (Outlook?) usually can’t.\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Do you think these are good reasons? Are there other reasons you  would include above some of these?  Would they persuade you to stop using your computer’s address book?</p>"

However, since several months, spam was pourring.</p>\n<h1>Trac <span>&amp;</span> spam</h1>\n<h2>How to fight spam with Trac</h2>\n<p>There is not built-in mechanism in Trac to fight spam. However, \n<a href=\"http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/SpamFilter\">plugins</a> enable to setup\nseveral ways to stop spam (or at least, reduce it).</p>\n<p>One of them is <a href=\"http://akismet.com/\">Akismet</a>, a web service\nwho can tell you if some message is a spam or not. It is able to catch\nmost of the spam. A bayesian filter complement this service. A\nlearning step is mandatory and can become cumbersome when the vast\nmajority of the tickets you receive is just spam. I used those two\nmechanisms on my Trac instances.</p>\n<p>Another path is to require an account to post a ticket. Creating an\naccount each time you want to create a ticket for some software is\nburdensome. I did not want to do this to the poor souls that have\nfound a bug in one of my projects. An alternative is to setup a public\naccount and adding somewhere in the page some instructions on how to\nuse it when you want to open a ticket but don’t want to open an account.</p>\n<h2>Removing spam</h2>\n<p>Despite Akismet and the bayesian filter, I still got two or three\nspams a day. I catched them in my <span>RSS</span> flow or in my email if they were\nnot classified as spam.</p>\n<p>There are two steps to remove the spam:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>tell the bayesian filter by using the administration panel in the\n   web interface,</li>\n<li>remove the spam from the database using some SQLite commands\n   directly on the server hosting the Trac instance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Indeed, Trac does not propose the possibility to remove a ticket. Of\ncourse, there are plugins, but you must find them, install them, find\nhow to configure them, etc.</p>\n<p>Cumbersome.</p>\n<h1>GitHub</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com\">GitHub</a> is a popular source code hosting service\nwhich uses <a href=\"http://git-scm.com/\">Git</a> as a backend. This is a\nproprietary platform but a lot of open source projects have migrated\nto it, thanks to its features and the good performances.</p>\n<p>Everybody is on GitHub. This was the ideal opportunity.</p>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<p>First, GitHub allows to host Git repository. You push your Git\nrepositories. There is a nice and fast web interface to browse\nthem. However, I still keep an instance of\n<a href=\"http://cgit.luffy.cx\">cgit</a>.</p>\n<p>Then, GitHub is very popular because they drive people to fork\nprojects. With one single click, you can fork your favorite\nproject. You get a copy which is synchronised with the forked project.</p>\n<p>There is also a wiki (accepting many markup syntaxes). This wiki is\nalso available through Git.</p>\n<p>At last, GitHub offers a minimalistic ticket system. You open a\nticket, you make some comments, you can add a tag or two and you can\nclose it. That’s all. Quite light. But enough for small projects like mine.</p>\n<p>However, there is more! Do not open a ticket to send a patch. There is\nno way to attach files to tickets. You need to fork the project,\ncreate a branch with your patch and request a “pull” for your\nbranch. This will appear as a ticket but your commits will be linked\nto it. The author can then review and comment your branch, ask for\nsome changes and if he wants to integrate it, a simple merge is\nsufficient. He can even do it using the web interface. Convenient.</p>\n<p>Socially, you can comment commits, tickets, projects and subscribe to\na lot of events. You can receive and answers tickets by mail.</p>\n<p>However, an accound is mandatory to open a ticket. Since there is a\nlot of projects on GitHub, this account should be useful for a lot of software.</p>\n<p>To cut a long story short, even if GitHub is a proprietary platform,\nit offers nice and interesting features. More and more projects\nmigrate from <a href=\"http://code.google.com\">Google Code</a> to GitHub even if\nthere is less features on the latter.</p>\n<h2>Migration</h2>\n<p>I have searched for tools to migrate automatically tickets from Trac\nto GitHub. For example, there is <a href=\"http://syncwith.us/sd/\"><span>SD</span></a>.</p>\n<p>At last, I have done it manually. GitHub <span>API</span> is well documented and\nthere exists bindings in various languages including Python but it is\na very limited <span>API</span>. You can’t choose the number of the ticket nor its date.</p>\n<p>I have also rewritten <code>README</code> files to use the markdown markup and\navoid the use of wiki pages when possible.</p>\n<p>I have also put some <span>URL</span> redirections with the help of nginx.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, even if maintaining Trac instances was not a lot of\nwork, one thing that I do not have to do anymore. And no spam on\nGitHub, I assume.</p>"

First let’s get up-to-speed on the issue courtesy of Redditor deebeeoh: -</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px\"><em>“[GNOME] are proposing systemd as a dependency for GNOME Shell to function. systemd has made it quite clear that no port to other OS’s would be supported (or even easy due to technical details).</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px\"><em>In short, by depending on systemd, they force the OS to pick a particular init system which is only supported in Linux. This is all proposed for GNOME 3.2, so very soon.”</em></p>\n<h4>‘The future of GNOME is an OS”</h4>\n<p>Today, in reply to Debian’s Josselin Mouette on the issue of whether adopting the Linux-only <a title=\"Init\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Init\">init</a> replacement daemon ‘Systemd’ was an agreeable step to take, McCann wrote: -</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px\"><em>“The future of GNOME is as a Linux based OS.  It is harmful to pretend that you are writing the OS core to work on any number of different kernels, user space subsystem combinations, and core libraries.  That said, there may be value in defining an application development platform or SDK that exposes higher level, more consistent, and coherent API.  But that is a separate issue from how we write core GNOME components like the System Settings.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px\"><em>It is free software and people are free to port GNOME to any other architecture or try to exchange kernels or whatever.  But that is silly for us to worry about.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px\"><em>Kernels just aren’t that interesting.  Linux isn’t an OS.  Now it is our job to try to build one – finally.  Let’s do it.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px\"><em>I think the time has come for GNOME to embrace Linux a bit more boldly.”</em></p>\n<p>This bold, rather rousing, read is completely understandable in the context of GNOME becoming the best that it can.</p>\n<p>The good news is that the ‘systemd saga’ is on-going and many further discussions are yet to be had before any commitment to a decision is made either way.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:right\"><em><a href=\"http://mail.gnome.org/archives/desktop-devel-list/2011-May/msg00439.html\">GNOME Devel mailing list</a> via <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/he8oy/gnome_preparing_to_give_nonlinux_oss_the_boot/\">Reddit </a></em></p>\n <p><a href=\"http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/?flattrss_redirect&amp;id=15062&amp;md5=606709714d15341f39397c6a3ca2ff2e\" title=\"Flattr\"><img src=\"http://cdn.omgubuntu.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/flattr/img/flattr-badge-large.png\" alt=\"flattr this!\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/M_wlNBQ2kvALmVhoFYIzxh-vL94/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/M_wlNBQ2kvALmVhoFYIzxh-vL94/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap></a><br>\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/M_wlNBQ2kvALmVhoFYIzxh-vL94/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/M_wlNBQ2kvALmVhoFYIzxh-vL94/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap></a></p><div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/d0od?a=X4oibDBa7mA:Zji28Ipwa1s:wBxX2hOkimM\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/d0od?i=X4oibDBa7mA:Zji28Ipwa1s:wBxX2hOkimM\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/d0od?a=X4oibDBa7mA:Zji28Ipwa1s:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/d0od?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/d0od?a=X4oibDBa7mA:Zji28Ipwa1s:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/d0od?i=X4oibDBa7mA:Zji28Ipwa1s:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/d0od?a=X4oibDBa7mA:Zji28Ipwa1s:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/d0od?i=X4oibDBa7mA:Zji28Ipwa1s:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/d0od?a=X4oibDBa7mA:Zji28Ipwa1s:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/d0od?i=X4oibDBa7mA:Zji28Ipwa1s:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/d0od?a=X4oibDBa7mA:Zji28Ipwa1s:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/d0od?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/d0od/~4/X4oibDBa7mA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"><p><iframe src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~ah/f/tltaf7ulkf4ndacgsoikfv4jdo/300/250?ca=1&amp;fh=280#http%3A%2F%2Ffeedproxy.google.com%2F%7Er%2Fd0od%2F%7E3%2FX4oibDBa7mA%2F\" width=\"100%\" height=\"280\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\"></iframe></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/UbuntuGamer/~4/dMzfxtE2yA4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

Both OpenGL and Direct3D. To some extend inspired by gDEBugger and Windows PIX. We wanted a tool that would let us slice through huge games and CAD apps to the exact call which causes problems and be able to inspect the entire graphics state, including the shaders, textures and all the buffers. We ended up doing that, plus a lot more and we're just getting started. In other words it's the best thing since \"Human/Robot Emancipation Act of 3015\". </div><div><br></div><div>You begin by tracing your target application.

Next is support for multiple GL contexts, ability to export just a single frame from a trace (either as a trace file or a standalone C application), ability to start and stop tracing on a hot key and lots of other features soon.

Hear me out. If you haven't read the highlights of Nintendo's Terms of Service for\n\nthe 3DS yet, you should <a href=\"http://www.defectivebydesign.org/nintendo\">do that</a>.</p>\n\n<p>On one hand, it's \"just\" a games console. On the other hand, it's a\n\ncomputer, marketed to children, which monitors your location (based on\n\nproximity to wifi access points), uploads your photos and messages to\n\nNintendo's servers (giving them a license to re-use that information\n\nin various ways), and tracks your activity. Now that's entertainment.</p>\n\n<p>If you wanted your Nintendo computer to stop doing those things, you\n\ncould try to install some 3rd-party \"homebrew\" software on it. Except\n\nthen, according to the Terms, Nintendo would \"brick\" your device —\n\nrender it inoperable, when the modified software is detected. Would\n\nyou accept Ford disabling your car because you had a mechanic friend\n\nfix a problem using some aftermarket parts? Microsoft breaking your\n\ncomputer hardware because you installed Firefox?</p>\n\n<p>The ability to stop your electronics from spying on you is an\n\nimportant freedom to defend, even if you don't ever plan on purchasing\n\na Nintendo device. Such terms, and the Digital Restrictions Management\n\nsoftware that enforces them, are a problem in all areas of digital\n\nlife. It's the same fundamental strategy as Apple controlling what you\n\ncan install on the iPhone or iPad, or <a href=\"http://www.defectivebydesign.org/sony\">Sony sending police officers</a> to\n\na programmer's house because he showed other people how to modify\n\ntheir own computers to make them able to run non-Sony-approved\n\nsoftware.</p>\n\n<p>If we don't set a strong precedent against this behavior, it will\n\nbecome more prevalent. If we lose the ability to install what we like\n\non our computers, then we lose the ability to use those computers in\n\nany way that isn't pre-approved by a corporation. We lose it not only\n\nbecause we ourselves can't install some software — maybe we hate\n\nchanging anything on our computers at all — but because the people\n\nwho write the software we rely on lose that freedom, which ends up\n\nimpacting even the most non-technical of computer users.</p>\n\n<p>\nCompanies like to portray anyone arguing for this freedom as criminals just wanting to illegally copy software. But that's obviously not true -- a person who follows all laws, even the most absurd, might still want to install something to stop Nintendo from receiving copies of her photos or reporting on her location. Companies use the threat of illegal copying to justify massive infringements on real personal freedoms.\n</p>\n\n<p>People often say, \"well, just don't buy it then\". I agree — don't buy\n\nit. But don't think this is merely a consumer issue. Terms like\n\nNintendo's are backed by the force of criminal law — the Digital\n\nMillennium Copyright Act in the US for example — which can put you in\n\njail for helping people to modify their own computers. So this is more\n\nthan a mere preference issue, it's also one of law and\n\nethics. It's not a free market when one side has coercive state\n\nresources in play to prop up its arbitrary business model.</p>\n\n<p>To help send this message, I just donated <a href=\"http://www.defectivebydesign.org/nintendo3ds\">to send 5 bricks</a> to\n\nNintendo. I hope you'll send one or five too. The campaign has a goal\n\nof sending 200 bricks by the end of today (Monday, May 16th). Nintendo\n\nclearly wants to get into the brick-making business, so surely they'll\n\nappreciate the extra inventory.</p>\n\n<p><em>(Disclosure: While I do work for the Free Software Foundation and am\n\npaid partly to run the Defective by Design campaign, I really did\n\ndonate, and support this campaign personally.)</em></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/wjsullivan/~4/ZfWaVR0jbgY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

After some lag, it is now time to have all these packages up-to-date into the archive.</p>\n\t<p>Here is an update of their status in Debian:</p>\n\t<ul>\n\t<li><strong>LLVM</strong><br>\nLLVM <a href=\"http://packages.debian.org/source/sid/llvm-2.8\">2.8</a> and <a href=\"http://packages.debian.org/source/experimental/llvm-2.9\">2.9</a> are now available into the archive.<br>\nFor version 2.8, Matthias Klose deserves most of the credit.<br>\nVersion 2.9 is available in experimental.<p></p>\n\t<p>They both build pretty well on most of the architectures besides kfreebsd. It is on my TODO list.\n</p></li>\n\t<li>\n<strong>Clang</strong>. A C/C++ compiler.<br>\nclang <a href=\"http://packages.debian.org/source/sid/clang\">2.8</a> and <a href=\"http://packages.debian.org/source/experimental/clang\">2.9</a> are respectively available in unstable and experimental.<br>\nThese versions cover most of C/C++ specifications and more and more big software (Qt, Boost, Scilab, etc) succeed to be built with it.<p></p>\n\t<p>Like LLVM, it is available under most of the Debian architectures (but I haven't tested the quality of the ASM generated).</p>\n\t<p>clang can be used just like gcc. With most of software, calling configure/make with CC=\"clang\" or CXX=\"clang\" should be enought.\n</p></li>\n\t<li>\n* <strong>Dragonegg</strong><br>\n<a href=\"http://packages.debian.org/source/sid/dragonegg\">Dragonegg</a> is a gcc plugin (llvm-gcc-4.5) which allows gcc to use optimizer and code generators of LLVM.<br>\nIt is now straightforward to use:<br>\n<code><br>\nllvm-gcc -o foo foo.c<br>\n</code><p></p>\n\t<p>I have lighten the \"contact\" between the gcc version used to build the extension and the version used to run it.<br>\nIt required the exact same version of gcc (even if the sources say it is probably a too strong requirement).</p>\n\t<p>Now, a warning like this one is displayed:<br>\n<code><br>\nPotential incompatible plugin version. GCC: 4.5.3. Expected: 4.5.2<br>\nDefines 'dragonegg_disable_version_check' as env variable to remove this warning<br>\nPlease note that unexpected errors might occur.<br>\n</code></p>\n\t<p>If there is a better way to tackle this issue, I will be happy to hear it.\n</p></li>\n\t<li>\n<strong>llvm-defaults</strong><br>\nLast but not least, I uploaded <a href=\"http://packages.debian.org/source/sid/llvm-defaults\">llvm-defaults</a>, a work of Arthur Loiret. This package allows a similar behavior to gcc-defaults. The installation of llvm will provide the default version of llvm.\n</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t<p><strong>Deprecated stuffs:</strong></p>\n\t<ul>\n\t<li><em>llvm</em><br>\nThe llvm package has been removed. Actually, it was just the version 2.6 of llvm (see <a href=\"http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=625729\">bug #625729</a>). llvm (from llvm-defaults) is now providing the favorite version of llvm.<p></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><em>llvm-gcc-4.2</em><br>\nUpstream stopped the development of this plugin.<br>\nIt has been removed from the archive (see <a href=\"http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=626007\">bug #626007</a>) and dragonegg is taking the relay.<p></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><em>llvm-snapshot</em><br>\nllvm-snapshot (see <a href=\"http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=626083\">bug #626083</a>) followed the same direction as llvm-gcc-4.2<p></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><em>llvm-2.7</em><br>\nllvm-2.7 is still in the archive (see <a href=\"http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=626081\">bug #626081</a>) because of some reverse dependencies...<p></p>\n\t</li>\n\t</ul>"

The system and most services (including web and mail) was set to use an MD RAID 1 array across two small partitions on two separate disks, and the remaining space was setup in three different btrfs file systems:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>One btrfs RAID 0 for shared data I wouldn’t mind having offline while fixing issues on one disk</li>\n<li>One btrfs RAID 1 for shared data I would mind having offline while fixing issues on one disk</li>\n<li>One last btrfs RAID 0 for entirely throwable things such as build chroots</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Three days ago, this happened:</p>\n<blockquote><pre>May 10 10:18:04 goemon kernel: [3545898.548311] ata4: hard resetting link\nMay 10 10:18:04 goemon kernel: [3545898.867556] ata4: SATA link up 1.5 Gbps (SStatus 113 SControl 310)\nMay 10 10:18:04 goemon kernel: [3545898.874973] ata4.00: configured for UDMA/33\n</pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p>followed by other ATA related messages, then, garbage such as:</p>\n<blockquote><pre>May 10 10:18:07 goemon kernel: [3545901.28123] sd3000 d]SneKy:AotdCmad[urn][ecitr\nMay 10 10:18:07 goemon kernel: 4[550.821 ecio es aawt es ecitr i e)\nMay 10 10:18:07 goemon kernel: 6[550.824     20 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 &lt;&gt;3491225     16 44 &lt;&gt;3491216]s ::::[d]Ad es:N diinlsneifrain&lt;&gt;3491216]s ::::[d]C:Ra(0:2 00 03 80 06 0<pre>3491217]edrqet / ro,dvsb etr2272\nMay 10 10:18:07 goemon kernel: 3[550.837 ad:sb:rshdln etr2252\nMay 10 10:18:07 goemon kernel: 6[551214]s ::::[d]Rsl:hsbt=I_Kdiebt=RVRSNE&lt;&gt;3491215]s ::::[d]SneKy:AotdCmad[urn][ecitr\nMay 10 10:18:07 goemon kernel: 4[550.833 ecitrsnedt ihsnedsrpos(nhx:&lt;&gt;3491216]    7 b0 00 00 c0 a8 00 00 0\n</pre>\n</pre></blockquote>\n<p>Then later on:</p>\n<blockquote><pre>May 10 12:01:18 goemon kernel: [3552089.226147] lost page write due to I/O error on sdb4\nMay 10 12:01:18 goemon kernel: [3552089.226312] lost page write due to I/O error on sdb4\nMay 10 12:10:14 goemon kernel: [3552624.625669] btrfs no csum found for inode 23642 start 0\nMay 10 12:10:14 goemon kernel: [3552624.625783] btrfs no csum found for inode 23642 start 4096\nMay 10 12:10:14 goemon kernel: [3552624.625884] btrfs no csum found for inode 23642 start 8192\n</pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p>etc. and more garbage.</p>\n<p>At that point, I wanted to shutdown the server, check the hardware, and reboot. Shutdown didn’t want to proceed completely. Btrfs just froze on the <code>sync</code> happening during the shutdown phase, so I had to power off violently. Nothing seemed really problematic on the hardware end, and after a reboot, both disks were properly working.</p>\n<p>The MD RAID would resynchronize, and the btrfs filesystems would be automatically mounted. It would work for a while, until such things could be seen in the logs, with more garbage as above in between:</p>\n<blockquote><pre>May 10 14:41:18 goemon kernel: [ 1253.455545] __ratelimit: 35363 callbacks suppressed\nMay 10 14:45:04 goemon kernel: [ 1478.717749] parent transid verify failed on 358190825472 wanted 42547 found 42525\nMay 10 14:45:04 goemon kernel: [ 1478.717936] parent transid verify failed on 358316642304 wanted 42547 found 42515\nMay 10 14:45:04 goemon kernel: [ 1478.717939] parent transid verify failed on 358190825472 wanted 42547 found 42525\nMay 10 14:45:04 goemon kernel: [ 1478.718128] parent transid verify failed on 358316642304 wanted 42547 found 42515\nMay 10 14:45:04 goemon kernel: [ 1478.718131] parent transid verify failed on 358190825472 wanted 42547 found 42525\n</pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Then there would be kernel btrfs processes going on and on sucking CPU and I/O, doing whatever it was doing. At such moment, most file reading off one of the btrfs volumes would either take very long or freeze, and un-mounting would only freeze. At that point, considering the advantages of btrfs (in my case, mostly, snapshots) were outweighed by such issues (this wasn’t my first btrfs fuck up, but by large, the most dreadful) and the fact that btrfs is just so slow compared to other filesystems, I decided I didn’t want to care trying to save these filesystems from their agonizing death, and that I’d just go with ext4 on MD RAID instead. Also, I didn’t want to just try (with the possibility of going through similar pain) again with a more recent kernel.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, I had backups of most of the data (only problem being the time required to restore that amount of data), but for the few remaining things which, by force of bad timing, I didn’t have a backup of, I needed to somehow get them back from these btrfs volumes. So I created new file systems to replace the btrfs volumes I could directly throw away and started recovering data from backups. I also, at the same time, tried to copy a big disk image from the remaining btrfs volume. Somehow, this worked, with the system load varying between 20 and 60… (with a lot of garbage in the logs and other services deeply impacted as well) But when trying to copy the remaining files I wanted to recover, things got worse, so I had to initiate a shutdown, and power cycle again.</p>\n<p>Since apparently the kernel wasn’t going to be very helpful, the next step was to just get other things working, and get the data back some other way. What I did was to use a virtual machine to get the data off the remaining btrfs volume. The kernel could become unusable all it wanted to, I could just hard reboot without impacting the other services.</p>\n<p>In the virtual machine, things got “interesting”. I did try various things I’ve seen on the linux-btrfs list, but nothing really did anything at all except spew some more <code>parent transid</code> messages. I should mention that the remaining btrfs volume was a RAID 0. To mount those, you’d mount one of the constituting disks like this:</p>\n<blockquote><p><code>$ mount /dev/sdb /mnt</code></p></blockquote>\n<p>Except that it would complain that it can’t find a valid whatever (I don’t remember the exact term, and I threw the VM away already) so it wouldn’t mount the volume. But when mounting the other constituting disk, it would just work. Well, that’s kind of understandable, but what is not is that on the next boot (I had to reboot a lot, see below), it would error out on the disk that worked previously, and work on the disk that was failing before.</p>\n<p>So, here is how things went:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I would boot the VM and mount the volume,</li>\n<li>launch an rsync of the data to recover, which I’d send onto the host system,</li>\n<li>observe, from the host system, what was going on I/O wise,</li>\n<li>at some point (usually after something like 10 to 50 files rsync’ed), after throwing a bunch of <code>parent transid</code> error messages, the VM would just stop doing any kind of I/O (even if left alone for several minutes), at which point I’d hard shutdown the VM and start over.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ain’t that fun?</p>\n<p>The good thing is that in the end, despite the pain, I recovered all that needed to be recovered. I’m in the process of recreating my build chroots from scratch, but that’s not exactly difficult. It would just have taken a lot more time to recover them the same way, 50 files at a time.</p>\n<p>Side note: yes, I did try newer versions of btrfsck ; yes I did try newer kernels. No, nothing worked to make these btrfs volumes viable. No, I don’t have an image of these completely fucked up volumes.</p>"

      "content" : "LightDM's a from-scratch implementation of an X display manager, ie the piece of software that handles remote X connections, starts any local X servers, provides a login screen and kicks off the initial user session. It's split into a nominally desktop-agnostic core (built directly on xcb and glib) and greeters, the idea being that it's straightforward to implement an environment-specific greeter that integrates nicely with your desktop session. It's about 6500 lines of code in the core, 3500 lines of code in the gtk bindings to the core and about 1000 in the sample gtk greeter, for a total of about 11,000 lines of code for a full implementation. This compares to getting on for 60,000 in gdm. Ubuntu plan to switch to LightDM in their next release (11.10).<br><br>This is a ridiculous idea.<br><br>To a first approximation, when someone says \"Lightweight\" what they mean is \"I don't understand the problems that the alternative solves\". People see gtk and think \"Gosh, that's kind of big for a toolkit library. I'll write my own\". And at some point they have to write a file dialog. And then they need to implement support for handling remote filesystems. And then they need to know whether the system has a functioning network connection or not, and so they end up querying state from Network Manager. And then they suddenly have a library that's getting on for the size of gtk, has about the same level of complexity and has had much less testing because why would you want to use a lightweight toolkit that either does nothing or is 90% of the size of the alternative and crashes all the time.<br><br>Adding functionality means that code gets larger. Given two codebases that are of significantly different sizes, the two possible conclusions are either that (a) the smaller one is massively more competently written than the larger one, or (b) the smaller one does less. The gdm authors have never struck me as incompetent, even if some people may disagree with some of their design decisions, and the LightDM authors don't seem to have argued on that basis either. So the obvious conclusion is that LightDM does less.<br><br>And, indeed, LightDM does less. Part of this is by design - as the <a href=\"http://mail.gnome.org/archives/desktop-devel-list/2010-October/msg00226.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">proposal</a> to the Gnome development list shows, one of the key advantages of LightDM is claimed as it not starting a Gnome session. And from that statement alone, we can already see that there's been a massive failure of understanding the complexity of the problem.<br><br>Let's go back to the comparisons of code size. LightDM's simple GTK greeter is about 1000 lines of code. gdm's greeter is almost 20,000. Some of this is arbitrary shiny stuff like the slidy effects that occur, but a lot of it is additional functionality. For example, some of it is devoted to handling the interface with AccountsService so gdm can automatically update when users are created or deleted. Some of it is providing UI for accessibility functionality. Some of it is drawing a clock, which I'll admit may be a touch gratuitous.<br><br>But if your argument is that your software is better because it's doing less, you should be able to ensure that you can demonstrate that the differences aren't important. And the differences here <em>are</em> important. For example, one of the reasons gdm starts a local gnome session is that it wants gnome-power-manager to be there to handle power policy. Closing the lid of my laptop should suspend the system regardless of whether it's logged in or not. LightDM takes a different approach. Because there's no session, it has to take care of this kind of thing itself. So the backend daemon code speaks to upower directly, and the greeters ask the daemon to implement their policy decisions.<br><br>This is pretty obviously miserable. Now you've got two sets of policy - one at the login screen, and one in your session. How do I ensure they're consistent? The only sane solution is to ignore the functionality the backend provides and have my greeter run gnome-power-manager. And now how about accessibility preferences? Again, if I want to have the same selection of policy, I need to run the same code. So you end up with a greeter that's about as complex and large as the gdm one, and unused functionality in the backend. Lighter weight through code duplication. We have always been at war with Eurasia.<br><br>The entirety of LightDM's design is based on a false premise - that you can move a large set of common greeter functionality into a daemon and just leave UI presentation up to the greeter code. And if you believe that, then yes, you can absolutely implement a greeter in 1000 lines of code. It'll behave differently to your desktop - the range of policy you can implement will be limited to what the daemon provides, even if your desktop environment has a different range of features. It'll have worse accessibility for much the same reason. And eventually you'll end up with a daemon that's absolutely huge in order to attempt to provide the superset of functionality that each different desktop makes use of.<br><br>The only real problem LightDM solves is that it makes it easier to write custom greeters, and if you're really seeking to differentiate your project based on your login screen then maybe your priorities are a little out of line. I'm sure that Ubuntu will release with a beautiful 3D greeter that has a wonderful transition to the desktop. It's just a shame that it won't do any of the useful things that the existing implementations already do.<br><br>And if you think that when LightDM finally has the full feature set of gdm, kdm and lxdm it'll still be fewer lines of code and take less memory - I hear the BSD kernel is lighter weight than Linux.

      "content" : "<p>(this post was going to be about something else, but after getting\nthis far, I think it stands on its own as an introduction to dynamic\nlinking)</p>\n\n<p>The shared library is an integral part of a modern system, but\noften the mechanisms behind the implementation are less well\nunderstood.  There are, of course, many guides to this sort of thing.\nHopefully this adds another perspective that resonates with\nsomeone.</p>\n\n<p>Let's start at the beginning — - <i>relocations</i> are\nentries in binaries that are left to be filled in later -- at link\ntime by the toolchain linker or at runtime by the dynamic linker.  A\n<i>relocation</i> in a binary is a descriptor which essentially says\n\"determine the value of X, and put that value into the binary at\noffset Y\" — each relocation has a specific <i>type</i>, defined\nin the ABI documentation, which describes exactly how \"determine the\nvalue of\" is actually determined.</p>\n\n<p>Here's the simplest example:</p>\n\n<div>\n<pre>$ cat a.c\nextern int foo;\n\nint function(void) {\n    return foo;\n}\n$ gcc -c a.c \n$ readelf --relocs ./a.o  \n\nRelocation section '.rel.text' at offset 0x2dc contains 1 entries:\n Offset     Info    Type            Sym.Value  Sym. Name\n00000004  00000801 R_386_32          00000000   foo\n</pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>The value of <tt>foo</tt> is not known at the time you make\n<tt>a.o</tt>, so the compiler leaves behind a <i>relocation</i> (of\ntype <tt>R_386_32</tt>) which is saying \"in the final binary, patch\nthe value at offset 0x4 in this object file with the address of symbol\n<tt>foo</tt>\".  If you take a look at the output, you can see at\noffset 0x4 there are 4-bytes of zeros just waiting for a real\naddress:</p>\n\n<div>\n<pre>$ objdump --disassemble ./a.o\n\n./a.o:     file format elf32-i386\n\n\nDisassembly of section .text:\n\n00000000 &lt;function&gt;:\n   0:\t 55\t\t\tpush   %ebp\n   1:\t 89 e5                \tmov    %esp,%ebp\n   3:\t a1 00 00 00 00       \tmov    0x0,%eax\n   8:\t 5d                   \tpop    %ebp\n   9:\t c3                   \tret    \n</pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>That's link time; if you build another object file with a value of\nfoo and build that into a final executable, the relocation can go\naway.  But there is a whole bunch of stuff for a fully linked\nexecutable or shared-library that just can't be resolved until\nruntime.  The major reason, as I shall try to explain, is\n<i>position-independent code</i> (PIC).  When you look at an\nexecutable file, you'll notice it has a fixed load address</p>\n\n<div>\n<pre>$ readelf --headers /bin/ls\n[...]\nELF Header:\n[...]\n  Entry point address:               0x8049bb0\n\nProgram Headers:\n  Type           Offset   VirtAddr   PhysAddr   FileSiz MemSiz  Flg Align\n[...]\n  LOAD           0x000000 0x08048000 0x08048000 0x16f88 0x16f88 R E 0x1000\n  LOAD           0x016f88 0x0805ff88 0x0805ff88 0x01543 0x01543 RW  0x1000\n</pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>This is <i>not</i> position-independent.  The code section (with\npermissions <tt>R E</tt>; i.e. read and execute) must be loaded at\nvirtual address <tt>0x08048000</tt>, and the data section\n(<tt>RW</tt>) must be loaded above that at exactly\n<tt>0x0805ff88</tt>.</p>\n\n<p>This is fine for an executable, because each time you start a new\nprocess (<tt>fork</tt> and <tt>exec</tt>) you have your own fresh\naddress space.  Thus it is a considerable time saving to pre-calculate\naddresses from and have them fixed in the final output (you can make\nposition-independent executables, but that's another story).</p>\n\n<p>This is not fine for a shared library (<tt>.so</tt>).  The whole\npoint of a shared library is that applications pick-and-choose random\npermutations of libraries to achieve what they want.  If your shared\nlibrary is built to only work when loaded at one particular address\neverything may be fine — until another library comes along that\nwas built also using that address.  The problem is actually somewhat\ntractable — you can just enumerate every single shared library\non the system and assign them all unique address ranges, ensuring that\nwhatever combinations of library are loaded they never overlap.  This\nis essentially what <i>prelinking</i> does (although that is a hint,\nrather than a fixed, required address base).  Apart from being a\nmaintenance nightmare, with 32-bit systems you rapidly start to run\nout of address-space if you try to give every possible library a\nunique location.  Thus when you examine a shared library, they do not\nspecify a particular base address to be loaded at:</p>\n\n<div>\n<pre>$ readelf --headers /lib/libc.so.6\nProgram Headers:\n  Type           Offset   VirtAddr   PhysAddr   FileSiz MemSiz  Flg Align\n[...]\n  LOAD           0x000000 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x236ac 0x236ac R E 0x1000\n  LOAD           0x023edc 0x00024edc 0x00024edc 0x0015c 0x001a4 RW  0x1000\n</pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>Shared libraries also have a second goal — code sharing.  If\na hundred processes use a shared library, it makes no sense to have\n100 copies of the code in memory taking up space.  If the code is\ncompletely read-only, and hence never, ever, modified, then every\nprocess can share the same code.  However, we have the constraint that\nthe shared library must still have a unqiue data instance in each\nprocess.  While it would be possible to put the library data anywhere\nwe want at runtime, this would require leaving behind relocations to\npatch the code and inform it where to actually find the data —\ndestroying the always read-only property of the code and thus\nsharability.  As you can see from the above headers, the solution is\nthat the read-write data section is always put at a known offset from\nthe code section of the library.  This way, via the magic of\nvirtual-memory, every process sees its own data section but can share\nthe unmodified code.  All that is needed to access data is some simple\nmaths; address of thing I want = my current address + known fixed\noffset.</p>\n\n<p>Well, simple maths is all relative!  \"My current address\" may or\nmay not be easy to find.  Consider the following:</p>\n\n<div>\n<pre>$ cat test.c\nstatic int foo = 100;\n\nint function(void) {\n    return foo;\n}\n$ gcc -fPIC -shared -o libtest.so test.c\n</pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>So <tt>foo</tt> will be in data, at a fixed offset from the code in\n<tt>function</tt>, and all we need to do is find it!  On amd64, this\nis quite easy, check the disassembly:</p>\n\n<div>\n<pre>000000000000056c &lt;function&gt;:\n 56c:\t\t 55\t\t\tpush   %rbp\n 56d:\t\t 48 89 e5             \tmov    %rsp,%rbp\n 570:\t\t 8b 05 b2 02 20 00    \tmov    0x2002b2(%rip),%eax        # 200828 &lt;foo&gt;\n 576:\t\t 5d                   \tpop    %rbp\n</pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>This says \"put the value at offset 0x2002b2 from the current\ninstruction pointer (<tt>%rip</tt>) into <tt>%eax</tt>.  That's it\n— we know the data is at that fixed offset so we're done.  i386,\non the other hand, doesn't have the ability to offset from the current\ninstruction pointer.  Some trickery is required there:</p>\n\n<div>\n<pre>0000040c &lt;function&gt;:\n 40c:\t 55\t\t\tpush   %ebp\n 40d:\t 89 e5                \tmov    %esp,%ebp\n 40f:\t e8 0e 00 00 00       \tcall   422 &lt;__i686.get_pc_thunk.cx&gt;\n 414:\t 81 c1 5c 11 00 00    \tadd    $0x115c,%ecx\n 41a:\t 8b 81 18 00 00 00    \tmov    0x18(%ecx),%eax\n 420:\t 5d                   \tpop    %ebp\n 421:\t c3                   \tret    \n\n00000422 &lt;__i686.get_pc_thunk.cx&gt;:\n 422:\t 8b 0c 24\t\tmov    (%esp),%ecx\n 425:\t c3                   \tret    \n</pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>The magic here is <tt>__i686.get_pc_thunk.cx</tt>.  The\narchitecture does not let us get the current instruction address, but\nwe can get a known fixed address — the value\n<tt>__i686.get_pc_thunk.cx</tt> pushes into <tt>cx</tt> is the return\nvalue from the <tt>call</tt>, i.e in this case <tt>0x414</tt>.  Then\nwe can do the maths for the <tt>add</tt> instruction; <tt>0x115c +\n0x414 = 0x1570</tt>, the final move goes <tt>0x18</tt> bytes past that\nto <tt>0x1588</tt> ... checking the disassembly</p>\n\n<div>\n<pre>00001588 &lt;global&gt;:\n    1588:       64 00 00                add    %al,%fs:(%eax)\n</pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>i.e., the value 100 in decimal, stored in the data section.</p>\n\n<p>We are getting closer, but there are still some issues to deal\nwith.  If a shared library can be loaded at any address, then how does\nan executable, or other shared library, know how to access data or\ncall functions in it?  We could, theoretically, load the library and\npatch up any data references or calls into that library; however as\njust described this would destroy code-sharability.  As we know, all\nproblems can be solved with a layer of indirection, in this case\ncalled <i>global offset table</i> or GOT.</p>\n\n<p>Consider the following library:</p>\n\n<div>\n<pre>$ cat test.c\nextern int foo;\n\nint function(void) {\n    return foo;\n}\n$ gcc -shared -fPIC -o libtest.so test.c\n</pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>Note this looks exactly like before, but in this case the foo is\n<tt>extern</tt>; presumably provided by some other library.  Let's\ntake a closer look at how this works, on amd64:</p>\n\n<div>\n<pre>$ objdump --disassemble libtest.so\n[...]\n00000000000005ac &lt;function&gt;:\n 5ac:\t\t 55\t\t\tpush   %rbp\n 5ad:\t\t 48 89 e5             \tmov    %rsp,%rbp\n 5b0:\t\t 48 8b 05 71 02 20 00 \tmov    0x200271(%rip),%rax        # 200828 &lt;_DYNAMIC+0x1a0&gt;\n 5b7:\t\t 8b 00                \tmov    (%rax),%eax\n 5b9:\t\t 5d                   \tpop    %rbp\n 5ba:\t\t c3                   \tretq   \n\n$ readelf --sections libtest.so\nSection Headers:\n  [Nr] Name              Type             Address           Offset\n       Size              EntSize          Flags  Link  Info  Align\n[...]\n  [20] .got              PROGBITS         0000000000200818  00000818\n       0000000000000020  0000000000000008  WA       0     0     8\n\n$ readelf --relocs libtest.so\nRelocation section &#39;.rela.dyn&#39; at offset 0x418 contains 5 entries:\n  Offset          Info           Type           Sym.

Which then pushes\nthe value <tt>0</tt> and jumps to <tt>0x4c0</tt>.  Looking at that\ncode we can see it pushes a value from the GOT, and then jumps to a\nsecond value in the GOT:</p>\n\n<div>\n<pre>00000000000004c0 &lt;foo@plt-0x10&gt;:\n 4c0:   ff 35 82 03 20 00       pushq  0x200382(%rip)        # 200848 &lt;_GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_+0x8&gt;\n 4c6:   ff 25 84 03 20 00       jmpq   *0x200384(%rip)        # 200850 &lt;_GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_+0x10&gt;\n 4cc:   0f 1f 40 00             nopl   0x0(%rax)\n</pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>What's going on here?  What's actually happening is <i>lazy\nbinding</i> — by convention when the dynamic linker loads a\nlibrary, it will put an identifier and resolution function into known\nplaces in the GOT.  Therefore, what happens is roughly this: on the\nfirst call of a function, it falls through to call the default stub,\nwhich loads the identifier and calls into the dynamic linker, which at\nthat point has enough information to figure out \"hey, this\n<tt>libtest.so</tt> is trying to find the function <tt>foo</tt>\".  It\nwill go ahead and find it, and then patch the address into the GOT\nsuch that the <i>next</i> time the original PLT entry is called, it\nwill load the actual address of the function, rather than the lookup\nstub.  Ingenious!</p>\n\n<p>Out of this indirection falls another handy thing — the\nability to modify the symbol binding order.  <tt>LD_PRELOAD</tt>, for\nexample, simply tells the dynamic loader it should insert a library as\nfirst to be looked-up for symbols; therefore when the above binding\nhappens if the preloaded library declares a <tt>foo</tt>, it will be\nchosen over any other one provided.</p>\n\n<p>In summary — code should be read-only always, and to make it\nso that you can still access data from other libraries and call\nexternal functions these accesses are indirected through a GOT and PLT\nwhich live at compile-time known offsets.</p>\n\n<p>In a future post I'll discuss some of the security issues around\nthis implementation, but that post won't make sense unless I can refer\nback to this one :)</p>"

      "content" : "<p>In the new version of Lintian there has been some more changes to overrides as well as a couple of new changes.</p>\n<p>First of, we fixed a false-positive with the embedded-library tag. Lintian would incorrectly use the source-field of a binary package, when figuring out if a package was the “real library” and not an offender embedding the library. However, this field is allowed to contain the version of the source package (if you remember <a href=\"http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-controlfields.html#s-f-Source\" title=\"Debian Policy Manual 5.6.1\">Policy 5.6.1</a>) and Lintian did not correctly cope with that.</p>\n<p>Speaking of embedded libraries, we have accepted a (series of) patch(es) from Marcelo Jorge Vieira to detect a number of embedded versions of the jQuery javascript library (libjs-query-*).</p>\n<p>Antonio Terceiro also gave a couple of patches two make Lintian more accurate with the recent changes for Ruby packages.  Furthermore we also added a new experimental tag to catch duplicate files in /usr/share/doc.</p>\n<p>Lintian 2.5.0 also modifies the syntax and semantics of the overrides file. In 2.5.0 and newer <em>all “*” after the tag name are wildcards</em>; previously they only acted as wildcards in the beginning or the end of text after the tag.</p>\n<p>The “Multi-Arch”-aware reader might have noticed that this is not enough for packages marked “Multi-Arch: same”.  Some packages might emit different tags on different architectures and all files in the package (incl. the override file) must be byte-for-byte identical if the path is the same on all architectures.</p>\n<p>Andreas Beckmann proposed a solution that we have accepted, namely architecture dependent overrides.  With 2.5.0 and newer you can specify that a certain override is only for certain architecture.  The parser is currently somewhat naive and forgiving, so it does <em>not</em> support architecture wildcards and it will not check that the architectures are valid.  Now you get to do overrides like this:</p>\n<p><code><br>\n# We like our code without pic on x86, thank you<br>\n[i386]: shlib-with-non-pic-code<br>\n</code></p>\n<p>If you had not guessed it, we use the same format as is used in the Build-Depends field (except for the lack of wildcard support).  So you should be familiar with it. <img src=\"http://s2.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\"> </p>\n<p>Note that the syntax of the overrides should be backwards compatible, so unlike the <a href=\"http://nthykier.wordpress.com/2011/04/14/lintian-2-5-0rc1-and-newer-breaks-overrides/\" title=\"Lintian 2.5.0~rc1 (and newer) breaks overrides\">2.5.0~rc1 upload</a>, your overrides should still work!</p>\n<p>A little heads up for people going to DebConf11: We will do a Lintian BoF again this year, yay!</p>\n<br>  <a href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/nthykier.wordpress.com/31/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/nthykier.wordpress.com/31/\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/nthykier.wordpress.com/31/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/delicious/nthykier.wordpress.com/31/\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gofacebook/nthykier.wordpress.com/31/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/facebook/nthykier.wordpress.com/31/\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gotwitter/nthykier.wordpress.com/31/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/twitter/nthykier.wordpress.com/31/\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/nthykier.wordpress.com/31/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/stumble/nthykier.wordpress.com/31/\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/nthykier.wordpress.com/31/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/digg/nthykier.wordpress.com/31/\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/nthykier.wordpress.com/31/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/reddit/nthykier.wordpress.com/31/\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></a> <img src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=nthykier.wordpress.com&amp;blog=21789318&amp;post=31&amp;subd=nthykier&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1\" alt=\"\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" width=\"1\">"

He was a release manager for sarge and etch, and like many former release managers, he’s still involved in the Debian release team although as a release wizard (i.e. more of an advisory role than a day-to-day contributor). Oh, and he did the same with Ubuntu: on the picture on the left, he just announced the release of Ubuntu 10.04 from his Debian-branded laptop. <img src=\"http://raphaelhertzog.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\";-)\"> </p>\n\n<p>He has also been maintaining PAM in Debian for as long as can I remember and does a great job at that. He’s very knowledgeable and fully deserves his place within the Debian Technical Committee. I’m glad he still has the time to participate on several important Debian mailing lists because his contributions are always very useful.</p>\n\n<p>I’m sure you’ll notice this just by reading his answers below. My questions are in bold, the rest is by Steve.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who are you?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I’m 32 years old, have been running Linux since my first year in college\nback in ’96, and have been a Debian developer now for ten years.  Along\nthe way I’ve been involved in maintaining a variety of server packages,\nworked on the Alpha port for a while, did a stint as a release manager\nfor a couple of years, and serve on the technical committee.</p>\n\n<p>This year I’m also celebrating my ten year anniversary with my lovely\nwife Patty, who many know as an erstwhile front-desk volunteer at\nDebConf.  God only knows why she puts up with my late-night hacking!</p>\n\n<p>These days in my day job I’m a manager on the Ubuntu Platform team at\nCanonical, working to help make Ubuntu a daughter distribution that the\nDebian community can be proud of.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What’s your biggest achievement within Debian or Ubuntu?</strong></p>\n\n<p>There’s no doubt that my biggest achievement in Debian has been overseeing\nthe release of two Debian releases as release manager.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, the scope of a release is so huge, and it represents\nthe output of so many developers working together, that it would be\narrogant to claim the release itself as an achievement of my own.  Also,\nsarge and etch have long since been rotated off of the mirrors so no one\ncares about them anymore. <img src=\"http://raphaelhertzog.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\";)\">   For a more personal and lasting\ncontribution in the distro itself, I’m very proud of writing\npam-auth-update.  It’s a small piece of code, but one that Debian was\nmissing for a long time – it’s made a big difference to PAM module\nintegration in packages!</p>\n\n<p><strong>What are your plans for Debian Wheezy?</strong></p>\n\n<p>My top priority for this cycle is to see multiarch through.  We’re still \nnot far enough along in Debian for most developers to see any \ndifference… and once we are, the first thing people are going to see \nis a fair bit of breakage when we start breaking a lot of assumptions \nabout paths that have been hard-coded upstream.  But I’m still excited \nby the progress that is being made here.  We should be able to ship \nwheezy without any ia32-libs package.  We might even be able to get rid \nof all the biarch library packages, including those used by the \ntoolchain itself.  54 packages in testing build-depend on gcc-multilib \nright now, in order to build 32-bit code to ship in the amd64 package; a \nbunch of those should go away with absolutely no reduction in \nfunctionality, saving us a bit of space in the archive and saving the\nmaintainers a <strong>lot</strong> of complexity in their packages, while at the same\ntime giving us much better support for cross-compilation than we’ve ever\nhad before.</p>\n\n<p>It’s a tall order, certainly, but the pieces are falling into place one by one.</p>\n\n<p>My second priority is to get a policy in Debian around packages\nintegrating upstart jobs.  It would of course benefit Ubuntu to have\nmany packages back in sync with Debian, but if all we wanted was to sync\nwith Debian, we could mostly just make debhelper ignore upstart jobs in\nDebian, prefer them in Ubuntu, and call it good.  I’m interested in\nmaking sure Debian also gets the benefits of being able to <strong>use</strong>\nupstart, because as Linux has become increasingly asynchronous (doing\nmore in parallel at start up), the traditional sysvinit has not been\nable to keep up.  There are all kinds of bugs now related to network\nstartup, for instance, that we don’t have a good answer for in a sysvinit\nmodel but that we can fix with an event-based system.</p>\n\n<p>Upstart has been around for a while now, but we’ve been slow to\nintegrate it into Debian because it only works on Linux.  It would be a\nshame if right after the first Debian GNU/kFreeBSD technology preview,\npackages all stopped working on kFreeBSD because they started to assume\nthe availability of upstart!  Unfortunately, having been so cautious we now\nhave systemd on the scene, which not only doesn’t support non-Linux but seems\nto be in the process of trying to gobble up other, non-Linux-specific\ncomponents of the desktop stack.  So I have to wonder what the future holds\nfor the free desktop on non-Linux kernels.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you could spend all your time on Debian, what would you work on?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Well, based on my previous experiences when I <em>did</em> spend all my time on\nDebian, I think the answer here is QA / release work. <img src=\"http://raphaelhertzog.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\">   Otherwise, I don’t\nknow.  My hands are full enough now with multiarch that it’s hard for me to\nsee what the Next Thing would be.</p>\n\n<p><strong>You’re a member of the technical committee. In the <a href=\"http://raphaelhertzog.com/2011/03/28/people-behind-debian-bdale-garbee-chair-of-the-technical-committee/\">interview of Bdale Garbee</a>, I have argued that it’s not working well. What’s your point of view on this topic?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Well, I feel a constant low level guilt about my own poor level of\nactivity in the TC; but that doesn’t translate into a belief that the\n<strong>system</strong> is broken.  This is, after all, the decision making body of last\nresort for technical disputes in Debian, and as such it should really be\nused sparingly.  And if a reputation for glacial deliberation means more\ndevelopers work out their disputes on their own rather than asking the TC\nto step in, I think that’s actually a healthy thing!</p>\n\n<p>I do still wish we were more effective at resolving those issues that do\ncome our way, but there’s no silver bullet for this.  Though the funny thing\nis, I’ve noticed that the majority of issues that get referred to the TC\nnowadays never even need us to make a decision; a short conversation with\nthe disputants is often enough to get them to come to an agreement.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What’s the biggest problem of Debian?</strong></p>\n\n<p>By and large, I think Debian is still doing a great job at what it’s\nbest at — delivering a rock-solid distribution that users can rely on.\nIf I would highlight one problem in Debian, though, it would be that I\nthink we’re becoming less innovative as time goes on.  Part of that comes\nfrom being such a large project that we’re bound to be more conservative\nas an institution; but even though the three pet Debian projects of mine\nthat I mentioned above are fairly innovative (multiarch, pam-auth-update,\nupstart), <strong>each</strong> of these has landed first in Ubuntu rather than in\nDebian.  Always with a clear intent of pushing back up into Debian, of\ncourse, but it just wasn’t possible to do this work within Debian for\nthe first cut without much longer delays.</p>\n\n<p>I worry that if Debian is no longer the place to try new things, that \nwe’re going to miss out on attracting contributions from the folks who \nare inspired to make Free Software better – and not simply to make it \nstable.</p>\n\n<p>I’m not sure how to address this, though.  Maybe improved conversations \nwith derivatives such as (but not limited to) Ubuntu, about what crack \nof the day is being tried where and how that can be integrated into \nDebian once it’s proven to work?  I don’t think that team-based \nmaintenance or low-threshold NMUs do anything to address this, though, \nas the kinds of innovation that matter most are ones that require \ndiscussion and consensus-finding — not just routing around inactive \nmaintainers.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you have wishes for Debian Wheezy?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Well, I’d like to see the armhf port get on its feet and become an \nofficial port.  Over the lifetime of the arm and armel ports, the state \nof the art on ARM has changed quite a bit; it would be great to see \nDebian taking advantage of this richer platform, to let people make \nbetter use of their hardware via Debian.</p>\n\n<p><strong>As a former release manager, you’re now a “release wizard”. I guess you have seen it on debian-devel, there are proposals to not freeze testing and to use another distribution starting as a snapshot of testing to finalize the new stable release. According to your experience, what needs to happen to make this possible?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Frankly, I’ve stayed out of that discussion because I don’t think what’s \nbeing asked for <strong>is</strong> possible.  I think proponents of a freezeless \nrelease have seriously underestimated the amount of work required on the \npart of the release team to wrangle testing into a releasable product, \nand that anything that makes propagation of fixes into the pending \nrelease more time consuming will make Debian worse on the whole, not \nbetter.</p>\n\n<p>If people really want to avoid long freezes for the Debian release, the \nbest way they can help this happen is by making Debian more <strong>releasable</strong> \non an ongoing basis, by helping to hold our packages to our shared \nstandards for quality (i.e., by fixing RC bugs!).  The biggest factor in \nlong freezes for Debian is the slow rate at which we bring the RC bug \ncount down during the freeze.  Back in the sarge, etch days we used to \nhave really great bug squashing parties that would get people together \non weekends to hack through RC bugs by the dozens.  I don’t see that \nhappening as much anymore.  I’d really like us to get back to that, but \nmy few attempts at this so far since retiring as release manager have led me to think \nI’m really terrible at organizing parties of any kind. <img src=\"http://raphaelhertzog.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\"> </p>\n\n<p>On the other side, as seen at \n<a href=\"http://bugs.debian.org/release-critical/\">http://bugs.debian.org/release-critical/</a>, the RC bug count for testing \nat the beginning of the release cycle keeps getting higher and higher. \nI’d love to know why that is so we can address it.  I know we’ve gotten \nbetter at detecting some classes of RC bugs; that’s part of it, but I \ndon’t think it explains the whole trend.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Is there someone in Debian that you admire for their contributions?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Wow, what kind of arrogant jerk would I be if I didn’t admire anyone in \nDebian for their contributions?  Debian is and always has been an \namazing community of top-notch developers; there are certainly too many \nI admire to list them all here.  Joey Hess certainly makes the list, for \nhis longstanding example of code speaking louder than words and for his \nability to get to the heart of common problems and come up with elegant \nsolutions.  So does Russ Allbery, who by all accounts had his ability to \nfeel anger in response to email burned out of him at a young age in a\nflame-related accident on Usenet. <img src=\"http://raphaelhertzog.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\";-)\">   The list goes on, but here I think\nI have to follow Joey’s example and cut the words short.</p>\n\n<hr>\nThank you to Steve for the time spent answering my questions.

However I’m not pleased with the <a href=\"http://www.lucas-nussbaum.net/blog/?p=659\" rel=\"nofollow\">proposed</a> <a href=\"http://raphaelhertzog.com/2011/04/29/do-we-need-project-wide-support-for-debian-rolling/\" rel=\"nofollow\">ideas</a>, since they don’t actually include any serious plan to make this happen. Sorry guys, but a big GR that says « We want a <strike>pony</strike> rolling release to happen » doesn’t achieve anything.</p>\n\n<p>Let me elaborate. First of all, discussions have focused a lot on what to do when we’re in a freeze phase. Numerous cool ideas have been proposed, including PPAs (which again, won’t happen until someone implements them). This is all good, but this is only the tip of the iceberg. Above all, before wondering what can happen in a freeze that lasts 20% of the time, let’s wonder what can happen for the 80% remaining time. Once you have something that works in the regular development phase, you can tune it to make it happen, even if in a less optimal way, when the distribution is frozen. So let’s not put the cart before the horse.</p>\n\n<p>There are three options if you want to make a rolling release happen.\n</p><ol>\n<li><b>Make <i>unstable</i> usable.</b> to make it happen, you have to prevent the disasters that rarely but unavoidably happen here. You don’t want to make all rolling systems unusable because someone broke grub or uploaded a new version of udev that doesn’t work with the kernel.</li>\n<li><b>Make <i>testing</i> usable.</b> This sounds easy since RC-buggy packages are already prevented from migrating, but actually it is not. A large number of RC bugs are discovered at the time of testing migration, when some packages migrate and others don’t. Worst of all, they require several days to be fixed, and it is very often that they require several months, when one of the packages gets entangled in a transition.</li>\n<li><b>Create a new suite for <i>rolling</i> usage.</b></li></ol><p></p>\n\n<p>The proponents of the <a href=\"http://cut.debian.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">CUT</a> project obviously believe in option 2. Unfortunately, I haven’t seen many things that could make it happen. A possible way to fix the situation would be to run large-scale regression testing on several upgrade paths. I don’t know if there are volunteers for this, but that won’t be me. That would also imply to make a lot of <i>important</i> bugs RC, since they could have a major effect on usability, but the release team will not be keen to make it happen.</p>\n\n<p>Because of the testing situation, when someone asks me for a rolling release, I point her to <i>unstable</i> with <a href=\"http://packages.debian.org/unstable/apt-listbugs\" rel=\"nofollow\">apt-listbugs</a>. As of today, this is the closest thing we have to a rolling release, so we should probably examine more deeply option 1. Is it that complicated to write a tool to prevent upgrades to broken packages? A 2-day delay in mirror propagation and a simple list of broken packages/versions (like the <a href=\"http://wiki.debian.org/TopicDebianDevel\" rel=\"nofollow\">#debian-devel topic</a>, would be enough. Add an overlay archive, that works like <i>experimental</i>, and you can now handle freezes smoothly. Wait… isn’t that <a href=\"http://aptosid.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">aptosid</a>? We would probably gain a lot of insight from the people who invented this, instead of trying to reinvent the wheel.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, option 3 could open new horizons. There’s a risk that it might drive users away from the <i>testing</i> and <i>unstable</i> suites, and this makes us wonder how we could have proper testing for our packages. Still, build a process that would (and that’s really only an example) freeze unstable every month, give people 10 days to fix the most blatant issues, add a way to make security updates flow in from <i>unstable</i>, and you have a really nice rolling distribution.</p>\n\n<p>So overall, it only requires people to make things happen. You want option 2 to happen? Instead of working on GR drafts, start working with maintainers and release managers on ways to avoid breakage in testing. You want option 3 to happen? Start it as a new .debian.net service and see how it works. Personally, I’d be in favor of offering aptosid developers to become DDs and offer their solution as a Debian service. It would bring in new people rather than driving away existing developers from working on our releases.</p>"

      "direction" : "ltr",
      "content" : "<p>Recently on the Xorg-Devel mailing list, Michael Stapelberg, who is the author of the <a title=\"i3\" href=\"http://i3wm.org/\">i3</a> window manager posted a new tool, which presents a nice alternative to both xtrace and xscope called x11vis. This tool allows you to monitor every single X Request and have a report on what your program is doing, much like strace will tell you what’s going on with IO and valgrind will tell you what’s going on with memory. It’s especially important for window manager authors like myself since a lot of the bugs that we face are often complicated X11 related timing issues, race conditions, requests that don’t get processed or mysterious events that seemliness’s come out of nowhere.</p>\n<p>X11Vis is particularly powerful since it is insanely easy to use. Just clone it from <a href=\"https://github.com/x11vis/x11vis\">github</a>, install the deps using CPAN and then run the interceptor. Once that’s done you can just start your program on DISPLAY=127.0.0.1:0 (eg loopback to localhost, disp 0, since this is the network port that X11Vis is monitoring). From here, X11Vis will print a running report of everything your program is doing. Note that in order to make it work correctly, you need to disable server grabs within your program, since that could cause the interceptor and your program to both block on each other. The way I usually do this is to #define overload XGrabServer and XUngrabServer like this.</p>\n<pre>int XGrabServer_wrapper (Display *);\nint XUngrabServer_wrapper (Display *);\n\n#define XGrabServer XGrabServer_wrapper\n#define XUngrabServer XUngrabServer_wrapper\n\nint XGrabServer_wrapper (Display *d)\n{\n    int n = 1\n#ifdef ALLOW_SERVER_GRABS\n#undef XGrabServer\n    n = XGrabServer (d);\n#define XGrabServer XGrabServer_wrapper\n#endif\n    return m;\n}\n\nint XUngrabServer_wrapper (Display *d)\n{\n    int n = 1\n#ifdef ALLOW_SERVER_GRABS\n#undef XUngrabServer\n    n = XUngrabServer (d);\n#define XUngrabServer XUngrabServer_wrapper\n#endif\n    return m;\n}</pre>\n<p>This does mean that there might be some discrepancy in your program when running under X11Vis since it means that you are essentially allowing race conditions to happen where window states change in places where you can’t allow them to change (eg during reparenting). However, since these are so rare, it is usually not the case that they will block the debugging of your program.</p>\n<p>Once that’s done, you can use the <strong>x11vis</strong> tool to set markers in the execution of your program, eg x11vis -m “Starting the Buggy Behaviour”, do the thing which makes the bug and then x11vis -m “Stopped the Buggy Behaviour. Once that’s done, just exit your program (eg metacity –replace) and go to http://localhost:5523. This will start the X11Vis GUI.</p>\n<div><a href=\"http://smspillaz.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/screenshot-x11vis-gui-chromium.png\"><img title=\"Screenshot-X11vis gui - Chromium\" src=\"http://smspillaz.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/screenshot-x11vis-gui-chromium.png?w=640&amp;h=381\" alt=\"Screenshot-X11vis gui - Chromium\" width=\"640\" height=\"381\"></a><p>X11Vis</p></div>\n<p>As you can see here, we have a detailed view of every single request that my application makes. Obviously, because this is a window manager, that’s quite a lot of traffic to sort through, so I used those markets to hone in on the traffic that was causing problems. Currently I am trying to debug <a href=\"https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/unity/+bug/760436\">LP #760436</a>, where sometimes a window will open without it’s decorations, but shifted down although it did have decorations. I initially traced this down to the fact that the frame window didn’t actually change size while undecorating in certain cases, so this mean that compiz never received the event to signify the server geometry change. To counter that, I am refcounting when we do configuration to see which requests are coming from us that we need to process in this way, should there be one reference left behind that we haven’t processed yet since we never got an event for it.</p>\n<p>However, this plan was foiled because I was received mysterious unaccounted for events that caused my references to go into the negatives quite early on. Even though I did a full grep of the source for everything that could possibly generate a ConfigureNotify, I was still not able to find the source of these events.</p>\n<p>After looking through with X11Vis, I confirmed that the event wasn’t actually coming from a request of ours, but rather was coming twice because we were listening for it twice! See, the “event” member of each event is slightly different – one is the root window and one is the frame window itself. This is because we select for StructureNotifyMask on the frame window AND SubstructureNotifyMask on the root window, which means that every time a window gets configured, both the frame window and the root window get an event. Since this is quite a subtle difference, I don’t know how long it would have taken to find this issue without a tool like X11Vis, so I think Michael for his amazing work there <img src=\"http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\"> </p>\n<p>Which means that hopefully, I should have a fix for this bug which particularly annoys some people, but doesn’t seem to affect me unless I follow the 8 or so steps to reproduce that Omer Akram gave me. So expect a fix soon <img src=\"http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\"> </p>\n<br>  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/smspillaz.wordpress.com/781/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/smspillaz.wordpress.com/781/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/smspillaz.wordpress.com/781/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/delicious/smspillaz.wordpress.com/781/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gofacebook/smspillaz.wordpress.com/781/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/facebook/smspillaz.wordpress.com/781/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gotwitter/smspillaz.wordpress.com/781/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/twitter/smspillaz.wordpress.com/781/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/smspillaz.wordpress.com/781/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/stumble/smspillaz.wordpress.com/781/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/smspillaz.wordpress.com/781/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/digg/smspillaz.wordpress.com/781/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/smspillaz.wordpress.com/781/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/reddit/smspillaz.wordpress.com/781/\"></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=smspillaz.wordpress.com&amp;blog=1094742&amp;post=781&amp;subd=smspillaz&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">"

You can try this\nyourself:</p>\n\n<div>\n<pre>$ cat tls.c\nchar __thread *foo;\n\nchar* moo(void) {\n\treturn foo;\n}\n$ gcc -fPIC -o libtls.so -shared tls.c\n$ readelf -d ./libtls.so  | grep NEED\n 0x00000001 (NEEDED)                     Shared library: [libc.so.6]\n 0x00000001 (NEEDED)                     Shared library: [ld-linux.so.2]\n 0x6ffffffe (VERNEED)                    0x314\n 0x6fffffff (VERNEEDNUM)                 2\n</pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>Thread-local storage is worthy of a <a href=\"http://people.redhat.com/drepper/tls.pdf\">book of its own</a>,\nbut the gist is that this support function says \"hey, give me an\naddress of <tt>foo</tt> in <tt>libtls.so</tt>\", the magic being that\nif the current thread has never accessed <tt>foo</tt> then it may not\nactually have any storage for <tt>foo</tt> yet, so the dynamic linker\ncan allocate some memory for it lazily and then return the right\nthing.  Otherwise, every thread that started would need to reserve\nroom for <tt>foo</tt> \"just in case\", even if it never cares about\n<tt>moo</tt>.</p>\n\n<p>But looking a little closer at the symbols of <tt>libc.so</tt> is\nalso interesting.  <tt>libc.so</tt> doesn't actually have many\nfunctions you can override.

      "content" : "<p><a href=\"http://oss.tresys.com/pipermail/refpolicy/2011-March/004115.html\">Guido Trentalancia started an interesting discussion on the SE Linux policy development list about how to manage the evolution of the policy [1]</a>.</p>\n<h3>The Problem</h3>\n<p>The SE Linux policy is the set of rules that determine what access is granted. It assigns types to files and domains to processes and has a set of rules that specify all the permitted interactions between processes and files (among many other things). The policy evolves over time to match the requirements of programs (applications and daemons). As a program evolves the things that it does will change and the SE Linux policy will tend to evolve to permit the set of all operations that were requested by all versions because people only complain when things stop working not when excessive privilege is granted. So we need to periodically remove old allow rules from the policy.</p>\n<p>One difficulty in this regard is the fact that multiple versions of programs are often available for use at the same time. Debian in particular has a good history of providing separate packages for the old and new versions of programs such as Apache to meet the needs of users who want the tried and tested version and of users who want the newer version with better performance, more features, better documentation, or something else good. There is also a demand to have the same policy work with multiple versions of a distribution without excessive effort. Finally all the distributions that have SE Linux support have different people deciding when the new version of a daemon is ready for inclusion and therefore there is a need to support multiple versions for multiple distributions. So support for older versions of daemons can’t be removed easily.</p>\n<p>One of the things I do to make these things a little easier to manage is to put <b>ifdef(`distro_debian', `</b> before any Debian specific bits of policy. When policy is conditional and only used in Debian I can freely remove it at any future time if Debian works well without it. Also it doesn’t matter if such Debian specific policy allows access that is not needed or desired in other distributions, the only down-side to this is that sometimes other distributions need to repeat work that I did, they determine what access is needed for their configuration and discover that it was already enabled for Debian.</p>\n<h3>What is Valid Policy?</h3>\n<p>We went to only have “<b>Valid Policy</b>”  (as described by Christopher J. PeBenito), so the challenge is determining what is Valid Policy.</p>\n<p>It seems to me that there are three type of access granted by valid policy (it is debatable whether type #3 is valid):</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Access that is needed for an application to perform it’s minimal designed task.</li>\n<li>Access that is needed for the application to perform all the optional configurations, EG an ftpd running from inetd or as a daemon, and daemons like http server being granted access to ssl keys or not.</li>\n<li>Access that is needed to perform all the operations the application requests, but which the application doesn’t require or shouldn’t require if it worked correctly.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Some common operations that aren’t required include opening utmp for write, searching /root, and many other relatively innocuous access attempts which don’t affect the program operation if they are denied. There are also many things such as writing temporary files to /root that don’t seem unusual if the application developer is not considering SE Linux (but which are often considered bad practice anyway). Some of these things (like using /root for stuff that belongs in /var/lib) have the potential to break things (for the daemon or for other system processes) even if you don’t consider SE Linux.</p>\n<p>How to deal with those types:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In most cases this can be determined without too much effort. For example a web server needs to listen on port 80 and read files and directories that relate to data. When writing policy I can write a lot of the allow rules without even testing the application because I know from the design what it will do. A large part of the other access is obvious in a “I can’t believe I didn’t realise it would need this” sense.</li>\n<li>The main question here is whether we have booleans (settings which can be tuned at run-time by the sysadmin which determine how the policy works) to specify which optional tasks or whether we allow all access for optional configurations by default. The secondary question is when certain unusual corner cases should be not supported at all such that the people who do such unusual corner cases need to use <b>audit2allow</b> to generate local policy to allow their operations.</li>\n<li>Sometimes we have to allow things that we really don’t like. Even when we write policy to allow a daemon to do unusual things (such as using /root instead of /var/lib) it’s still a lot better than running without SE Linux. Also SE Linux policy to allow such obviously broken things stands out and is a constant reminder that the daemon needs fixing, this is better than allowing symptoms of broken design to be forgotten.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>How to Improve the Situation</h3>\n<p>We could have comments in the policy source for everything that is in category 3. If the comments had a fixed format so that a recursive grep could find them all then it would allow us to more easily remove the gross things from the policy at a later date.</p>\n<p>But it seems to me that the main problem is a lack of people working on this. I am not aware of any people actively testing Debian policy for excessive privilege in regard to such issues.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>[1]<a href=\"http://oss.tresys.com/pipermail/refpolicy/2011-March/004115.html\"> http://oss.tresys.com/pipermail/refpolicy/2011-March/004115.html</a></li>\n</ul>"

If you wish to delete certain lines, you just print the lines you're interested in. Or the other way around! For example, to delete all lines with even line numbers, print the odd lines, and to delete odd lines print the even lines.</p>\n<p>After I am done with the 8 parts of the article, I will release the whole article series as <strong>a pdf e-book</strong>! Please <a href=\"http://www.catonmat.net/feed/\">subscribe to my blog</a> to be the first to get it!</p>\n<p>Here are today's one-liners:</p>\n<p><strong>82. Print the first line of a file (emulate head -1).</strong></p>\n<pre>\nperl -ne 'print; exit'\n</pre>\n<p>This is the simplest one-liner so far. Here Perl reads in the first line into <code>$_</code> variable thanks to <code>-n</code> option, then it calls <code>print</code> statement that prints the contents of the <code>$_</code> variable. And then it just exists. That's it. The first line got printed and that's all we wanted.</p>\n<p><strong>83. Print the first 10 lines of a file (emulate head -10).</strong></p>\n<pre>\nperl -ne &#39;print if $. &lt;= 10&#39;\n</pre>\n<p>This one-liner uses the <code>$.</code> <a href=\"http://www.catonmat.net/blog/perls-special-variable-cheat-sheet/\">special variable</a>. This variable stands for \"current line number.\" Each time Perl reads in the next line, it increments <code>$.</code> by one. Therefore it's very simple to understand what this one-liner does, it <code>print</code>s the line if the line number is equal to or less than 10.</p>\n<p>This one liner can also be written the other way around without use of <code>if</code> statement,</p>\n<pre>\nperl -ne &#39;$. &lt;= 10 &amp;&amp; print&#39;\n</pre>\n<p>Here the <code>print</code> statement gets called only if <code>$. &lt;= 10</code> boolean expression is true, and it's true only if current line number is less than or equal to 10.</p>\n<p><strong>84. Print the last line of a file (emulate tail -1).</strong></p>\n<pre>\nperl -ne '$last = $_; END { print $last }'\n</pre>\n<p>Printing the last line of the file is a bit tricker, because you always have to maintain the previous line in memory. In this one-liner we always save the current line in <code>$_</code> to <code>$last</code> variable. When Perl program ends, it always executes code in the <code>END</code> block. Now just before exiting it read in the last line, so when it quits, we <code>print $last</code> that prints the last line.</p>\n<p>Another way to do the same is,</p>\n<pre>\nperl -ne 'print if eof'\n</pre>\n<p>This one-liner uses the <code>eof</code> function that returns 1 if the <strong>next read</strong> will return end of file. Since the next read after the last line in the file will really return eof, this one-liner does what it's supposed to do.</p>\n<p><strong>85. Print the last 10 lines of a file (emulate tail -10).</strong></p>\n<pre>\nperl -ne 'push @a, $_; @a = @a[@a-10..$#a]; END { print @a }'\n</pre>\n<p>Now this is tricky. Here we push each line to the <code>@a</code> array, and then we replace with a slice of itself. We do <code>@a = @a[@a-10..$#a]</code>, which means, replace <code>@a</code> with last 10 elements of a. <code>@a-10</code> is evaluated in scalar context here and it returns number of elements in the array minus 10. <code>#$a</code> is the last index in the <code>@a</code> array. And <code>@a[@a-10..$#a]</code> takes the last 10 elements of the array, so <code>@a</code> always contains just 10 last elements.</p>\n<p>Here is an example. Suppose <code>@a</code> contains <code>(\"line1\", \"line2\", \"line3\", \"line4\")</code>. And let's say we want to print last 4 lines of the file. Now when we read the 5th line, the array becomes <code>(\"line1\", \"line2\", \"line3\", \"line4\", \"line5\")</code>. At this moment <code>@a-4</code> is 1, because <code>@a</code> in scalar context is 5. The <code>$#a</code> however is 4 because that's the last index in the array. Now taking the slice, <code>@a[@a-4..$#a]</code> is <code>@a[1..4]</code>, which drops the front element from the array and the <code>@a</code> array becomes <code>(\"line2\", \"line3\", \"line4\", \"line5\")</code>.</p>\n<p><strong>86. Print only lines that match a regular expression.</strong></p>\n<pre>\nperl -ne &#39;/regex/ &amp;&amp; print&#39;\n</pre>\n<p>Here <code>/regex/</code> is short for <code>$_ =~ /regex/</code>. Since the <code>-n</code> operator puts every line in <code>$_</code> variable the <code>/regex/</code> returns true on all lines that matched the regex. If that happened, <code>print</code> prints the line.</p>\n<p><strong>87. Print only lines that do not match a regular expression.</strong></p>\n<pre>\nperl -ne &#39;!/regex/ &amp;&amp; print&#39;\n</pre>\n<p>This is the same as the previous one-liner, except the regular expression match has been negated. So all the lines that don't match the regex get printed.</p>\n<p><strong>88. Print the line before a line that matches a regular expression.</strong></p>\n<pre>\nperl -ne &#39;/regex/ &amp;&amp; $last &amp;&amp; print $last; $last = $_&#39;\n</pre>\n<p>In this one-liner every line gets saved to <code>$last</code> variable. Now when the next line matches <code>/regex/</code> and there has been a previous line <code>$last</code>, then it <code>print $last</code> prints the last line, and then it assigns the current line to the last line variable via <code>$last = $_</code>.</p>\n<p><strong>89. Print the line after a line that matches a regular expression.</strong></p>\n<pre>\nperl -ne 'if ($p) { print; $p = 0 } $p++ if /regex/'\n</pre>\n<p>Here we set the variable <code>$p</code> if the line matches a regex. It indicates that the next line should be printed. Now when the next line is read in and <code>$p</code> is set, then that line gets printed and <code>$p</code> gets set to 0 again to reset the state.</p>\n<p><strong>90. Print lines that match regex AAA and regex BBB in any order.</strong></p>\n<pre>\nperl -ne &#39;/AAA/ &amp;&amp; /BBB/ &amp;&amp; print&#39;\n</pre>\n<p>This one-liner is basically the same as one-liner #86 above. Here we test if a line matches two regular expressions instead of line. If a line matches both regexes, then it gets printed.</p>\n<p><strong>91. Print lines that don't match match regexes AAA and BBB.</strong></p>\n<pre>\nperl -ne &#39;!/AAA/ &amp;&amp; !/BBB/ &amp;&amp; print&#39;\n</pre>\n<p>This one-liner is almost the same as one-liner #87. Here we test if a line doesn't match two regular expressions in any order. If it doesn't match <code>/AAA/</code> and it doesn't match <code>/BBB/</code>, then we <code>print</code> it.</p>\n<p><strong>92. Print lines that match regex AAA followed by regex BBB followed by CCC.</strong></p>\n<pre>\nperl -ne &#39;/AAA.*BBB.*CCC/ &amp;&amp; print&#39;\n</pre>\n<p>Here we simply chain regexes AAA, BBB and CCC with <code>.*</code>, which stands for match anything or nothing at all. If AAA is followed by BBB and that is followed by CCC then we print the line. It also matches AAABBBCCC with nothing in between the regexes.</p>\n<p><strong>93. Print lines that are 80 chars or longer.</strong></p>\n<pre>\nperl -ne &#39;print if length &gt;= 80&#39;\n</pre>\n<p>This one-liner prints all lines that are 80 chars or longer. In Perl you can sometimes omit the brackets <code>()</code> for function calls. In this one we omitted brackets for <code>length</code> function call. In fact, <code>length</code>, <code>length()</code> and <code>length($_)</code> are the same.</p>\n<p><strong>94. Print lines that are less than 80 chars in length.</strong></p>\n<pre>\nperl -ne &#39;print if length &lt; 80&#39;\n</pre>\n<p>This is the opposite of previous one-liner. It checks if the length of a line is less than 80 characters.</p>\n<p><strong>95. Print only line 13.</strong></p>\n<pre>\nperl -ne &#39;$. == 13 &amp;&amp; print &amp;&amp; exit&#39;\n</pre>\n<p>As I explained in one-liner #83, the <code>$.</code> special variable stands for \"current line number\". So if <code>$.</code> has value 13, then we <code>print</code> the line and <code>exit</code>.</p>\n<p><strong>96. Print all lines except line 27.</strong></p>\n<pre>\nperl -ne &#39;$. != 27 &amp;&amp; print&#39;\n</pre>\n<p>Just like in previous one-liner, we check if the current line is line 27, if it's not then we <code>print</code> it, otherwise we skip it.</p>\n<p>Another way to write the same is to reverse <code>print</code> and <code>$. != 27</code> and use <code>if</code> statement,</p>\n<pre>\nperl -ne 'print if $. != 27'\n</pre>\n<p><strong>97. Print only lines 13, 19 and 67.</strong></p>\n<pre>\nperl -ne 'print if $. == 13 || $. == 19 || $. == 67'\n</pre>\n<p>If you have Perl 5.10 or later then you can use the <code>~~</code> smart match operator,</p>\n<pre>\nperl -ne 'print if int($.) ~~ (13, 19, 67)' \n</pre>\n<p>The smart matching operator <code>~~</code> appeared only in Perl 5.10. You can do all kinds of smart matching with it, for example, check if two arrays are the same, if an array contains an element, and many other use cases (see <code>perldoc perlsyn</code>). In this particular one-liner we use <code>int($.) ~~ (13, 19, 67)</code> that determines if numeric value <code>$.</code> is in the list (13, 19, 69). It's basically short for, <code>grep { $_ == int($._) } (13, 19, 67)</code>. If the check succeeds the line gets <code>print</code>ed.</p>\n<p><strong>98. Print all lines between two regexes (including lines that match regex).</strong></p>\n<pre>\nperl -ne 'print if /regex1/../regex2/'\n</pre>\n<p>This one-liner uses the flip-flop operator, which becomes true when a line matches <code>regex1</code> and becomes false after another line matches <code>regex2</code>. Therefore this one-liner prints all lines between (and including) lines that match <code>regex1</code> and <code>regex2</code>.</p>\n<p><strong>99. Print all lines from line 17 to line 30.</strong></p>\n<pre>\nperl -ne &#39;print if $. &gt;= 17 &amp;&amp; $. &lt;= 30&#39;\n</pre>\n<p>This one-liner is very simple to understand. The <code>$.</code> variable stands for the current line number, so it checks if the current line number is greater than or equal to 17 and less than or equal to 30.</p>\n<p>I just thought of another way to write it,</p>\n<pre>\nperl -ne 'print if int($.) ~~ (17..30)'\n</pre>\n<p>This is one-liner uses the Perl 5.10 (and later) smart matching operator <code>~~</code>. It basically says, is the current line number in the list (17, 18, 19, ..., 30). If it is, the smart match succeeds and the line gets printed.</p>\n<p>You can write the same idea in older Perls as following,</p>\n<pre>\nperl -ne 'print if grep { $_ == $. } 17..30'\n</pre>\n<p>What happens here is <code>grep</code> checks if the current line number is in the list (17, 18, ..., 30). If it is, it returns a list of just one element, and a list of one element is true, and the line gets printed. Otherwise <code>grep</code> returns the empty list, which is false, and nothing gets printed.</p>\n<p><strong>100. Print the longest line.</strong></p>\n<pre>\nperl -ne &#39;$l = $_ if length($_) &gt; length($l); END { print $l }&#39;\n</pre>\n<p>This one-liner keeps the longest line seen so far in the <code>$l</code> variable. In case the current line <code>$_</code> exceeds the length of currently longest line, it gets replaced. Just before exiting, the <code>END</code> block is executed and it prints the longest line <code>$l</code>.</p>\n<p><strong>101. Print the shortest line.</strong></p>\n<pre>\nperl -ne &#39;$s = $_ if $. == 1; $s = $_ if length($_) &lt; length($s); END { print $s }&#39;\n</pre>\n<p>This one-liner is the opposite of the previous one. But as we're finding the minimum and <code>$s</code> is not defined for the first line, we have to set it to first line explicitly. Otherwise it's the same just with the length check reversed <code>length($_) &lt; length($s)</code>.</p>\n<p><strong>102. Print all lines that contain a number.</strong></p>\n<pre>\nperl -ne 'print if /\\d/'\n</pre>\n<p>This one-liner uses a regular expression <code>\\d</code> that stands for \"match a number\" and checks if a line contains one. If it does, the check succeeds, and the line gets printed.</p>\n<p><strong>103. Find all lines that contain only a number.</strong></p>\n<pre>\nperl -ne 'print if /^\\d+$/'\n</pre>\n<p>This one-liner is very similar to the previous one, but instead of matching a number anywhere on the line, it anchors the match to the beginning of the line, and to the end of the line. The regular expression <code>^\\d+$</code> means \"match one or more numbers that start at the beginning of line and end at the end of the line\".</p>\n<p><strong>104. Print all lines that contain only characters.</strong></p>\n<pre>\nperl -ne 'print if /^[[:alpha:]]+$/\n</pre>\n<p>This one-liner checks if the line contains only characters and if it does, it <code>print</code>s it. Here the <code>[[:alpha:]]</code> stands for \"match all characters\". You could also write the same as <code>[a-zA-Z]</code> (if you live in ASCII world).</p>\n<p><strong>105. Print every second line.</strong></p>\n<pre>\nperl -ne 'print if $. % 2'\n</pre>\n<p>This one-liner prints first, third, 5th, 7th, etc, line. It does so because <code>$. % 2</code> is true when the current line number is odd, and it's false when the current line number is even.</p>\n<p><strong>106. Print every second line, starting the second line.</strong></p>\n<pre>\nperl -ne 'print if $. % 2 == 0'\n</pre>\n<p>This one-liner is very similar to the previous one but except printing 1st, 3rd, 5th, etc, lines, it prints 2nd, 4th, 6th, etc, lines. It prints them because <code>$. % 2 == 0</code> is true when the current line number is 2, 4, 6, ....</p>\n<p><strong>107. Print all lines that repeat.</strong></p>\n<pre>\nperl -ne 'print if ++$a{$_} == 2'\n</pre>\n<p>This one-liner keeps track of the lines it has seen so far and it also keeps the count of how many times it has seen the line before. If it sees the line the 2nd time, it prints it out because <code>++$a{$_} == 2</code> is true. If it sees the line more than 2 times, it just does nothing because the count for this line has gone beyond 2 and the result of the print check is false.</p>\n<p><strong>108. Print all unique lines.</strong></p>\n<pre>\nperl -ne 'print unless $a{$_}++'\n</pre>\n<p>Here the lines get printed only if the hash value <code>$a{$_}</code> for the line is 0. Every time Perl reads in a line, it increments the value for the line and that makes sure that only never before seen lines get printed.</p>\n<h2>Have Fun!</h2>\n<p>Thanks for reading the article! The next part is going to be about various interesting, intriguing, silly and crazy regular expressions, because Perl is all about regular expressions.</p>\n<div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/catonmat?a=Iwy41EImkeA:WflM6jksbeI:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/catonmat?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/catonmat?a=Iwy41EImkeA:WflM6jksbeI:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/catonmat?i=Iwy41EImkeA:WflM6jksbeI:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/catonmat?a=Iwy41EImkeA:WflM6jksbeI:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/catonmat?i=Iwy41EImkeA:WflM6jksbeI:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/catonmat?a=Iwy41EImkeA:WflM6jksbeI:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/catonmat?i=Iwy41EImkeA:WflM6jksbeI:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/catonmat/~4/Iwy41EImkeA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

The reason why the reporter wrote to me and suspected a bug in my builds\nwas, that the same game worked on the system of a friend (using a different\ndistribution). After some exchanged e-mails it became apparent that this was yet\nanother installment of <a href=\"https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/S3TC\" title=\"Wikipedia: S3 Texture Compression\">S3TC-compressed textures</a>. And as\nthis wasn't the first time I got such reports, I thought I blog about the\nsolution today.</p>\n<p>As S3TC is one of those patent-encumbered texture compression formats (don't\nask me why one can get a patent for such things, it's, <acronym title=\"In My Humble Opionion\">IMHO</acronym>, a very bad thing and we'd be better\noff, with a lot less patents), Mesa doesn't support it out of the box. You need\nto install an additional library or the proprietary driver for your graphics\ncard. Before installing the library, make sure, that it is legal in your\njurisdiction (i.e. check whether the patent is valid in your jurisdiction). If\nthat is the case, you can install <tt>libtxc-dxtn0</tt> from <a href=\"http://debian-multimedia.org/pool/main/libt/libtxc-dxtn/libtxc-dxtn.php\" title=\"Christian Marillat&#39;s Debian Multimedia repository\">the Debian Multimedia\nrepository</a> or compile it yourself <a href=\"http://cgit.freedesktop.org/~mareko/libtxc_dxtn/\" title=\"Marek Olšák&#39;s Git repository for libtxc_dxtn\">from source</a>. If the\npatent is valid in your jurisdiction, you're most likely required to get a\nlicense from the rights holder for using the library, but I'm no lawyer so you\nmight want to consult one prior to making your decision.</p>\n<p>For <tt>amd64</tt> users, there is an additional caveat: Wine needs the 32\nbit variant installed. At the moment, this means downloading the <tt>i386</tt>\npackage from debian-multimedia.org and extracting the library to\n<tt>/usr/lib32</tt>.</p>\n<p>For users with the r600c/g driver it gets (currently) really tricky,\nas there is <a href=\"http://wiki.x.org/wiki/RadeonFeature?action=recall&amp;rev=187\" title=\"Radeon driver status page\">no fully working support for loading\n<tt>libtxc_dxtn.so</tt></a> (current status is <acronym title=\"Work In Progress\">WIP</acronym>). Here the only solution I know, would be\nto use the proprietary driver or writing patches for r600g (last option\npreferred *g*).</p>"

I am actually amazed people still do this!  The standard way of holding passwords that has been around for years is to encrypt or hash the password and store the result, called a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciphertext\" rel=\"wikipedia\" title=\"Ciphertext\">ciphertext</a>.  There have been many ways of hashing the password, starting off with plain old <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypt_%28Unix%29\" rel=\"wikipedia\" title=\"Crypt (Unix)\">crypt</a> with no <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_%28cryptography%29\" rel=\"wikipedia\" title=\"Salt (cryptography)\">salt</a> (a random pair of characters) then crypt with salt through to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5\" rel=\"wikipedia\" title=\"MD5\">MD5</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1\" rel=\"wikipedia\" title=\"SHA-1\">SHA</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The thing is, each one of these hashing techniques results in a ciphertext in a different length.  Now with most languages, this doesn’t matter because you know what hash you are using; its simply the name of the function or some flag you set.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.php.net/\" rel=\"homepage\" title=\"PHP\">PHP</a> is different, because all of these methods use the one function called <a href=\"http://www.php.net/crypt\">crypt</a> which is a little confusing because it is more than plain old crypt.  Around the PHP version 5.3 the developers started putting in the more complex hash algorithms which is good, but the ciphertext has been growing.</p>\n\n<p>A lot of applications store this hashed password in a database and the decision needs to be made; how big should this field be?  For a long while, 50 characters would be enough and this is what programs like <span><a href=\"http://www.jffnms.org/\">jffnms</a></span> use.  Unfortunately the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2\" rel=\"wikipedia\" title=\"SHA-2\">SHA-512</a> algorithm needs 98 characters so what you get is half a hash stored. When the user enters their password, the program compares the full hash from that password to the half hash in the database and it always fails.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve adjusted JFFNMS to use 200 character long fields which is fine for now. The problem is who knows what the future will bring?\n</p><h6 style=\"font-size:1em\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul>\n    <li><a href=\"http://www.boingboing.net/2011/04/11/france-to-require-cl.html\">France to require cleartext password storage</a> (boingboing.net)</li>\n    <li><a href=\"http://it.slashdot.org/story/11/02/09/1317253/Are-You-Sure-SHA-1Salt-Is-Enough-For-Passwords\">Are You Sure SHA-1+Salt Is Enough For Passwords?</a> (it.slashdot.org)</li>\n    <li><a href=\"http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/md5-hash-stuff-means-technology-explained/\">What All This MD5 Hash Stuff Actually Means [Technology Explained]</a> (makeuseof.com)</li>\n    <li><a href=\"http://techie-buzz.com/tech-news/amazon-password-security-flaw.html\">Serious Security Flaw in Amazon.com Passwords</a> (techie-buzz.com)</li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"margin-top:10px;height:15px\"><a href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/\" title=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\"></a></div><p></p>"

They become even more interesting when set against the <a href=\"http://www.comscore.com/Press_Events/Press_Releases/2011/4/comScore_Reports_February_2011_U.S._Mobile_Subscriber_Market_Share?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+comscore+%28comScore%2C+Inc.%29\">ComScore numbers</a> covering Nov 2010 to February 2011, which I previously analyzed in <a href=\"http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=3103\">The Smartphone Wars: Almost boring now…</a>. </p>\n<p><span></span></p>\n<p>The article does not say outright whether Kantar is reporting new-unit sales or total installed base, but the Kantar November 2010 figures for Microsoft, RIM, and Apple are so close to comScore’s from July 2010 that I think it must be the total installed base.  Their differences max out at about 4%, which is not far above statistical noise level, and fit their known market-share trend lines for that period. Android is 19% in Kantar’s June 2010 results vs. 26% in comScore’s November 2010 ones, which can be accounted for by the (known) phenomenal growth between June and November.  </p>\n<p>So it appears the comScore and Kantar numbers are comparable.  But if I’ve been fooled by a numerical coincidence, that’s not going to make a long-term difference.  In a market turning over technology and units as fast as smartphones are, installed base doesn’t lag new-unit sales by a whole lot.  If the Kantar figures aren’t describing total installed base now, they’re predicting it in 3 to 6 months.</p>\n<p>At the risk of reducing the rest of this post to anticlimax, I will first report that Kantar measures Android market share in the U.S. at 54.7% in March 2011.  This is a 21% jump from comScore’s February figures <em>in a single month</em>.  It suggests that, a good six months sooner than I expected, Android is entering the final runaway to uncontested market dominance at 85% or up.</p>\n<p>It’s certainly not looking like any competitor has what it takes to stop Android. Kantar has Symbian at 1.2%, Microsoft at 4.9%, RIM at 10.6% and Apple at %27.2.  While regaining second place is good news for Apple, this is mostly because RIM is going down in flames; a gain of less than 2% since February isn’t going to do diddly to Android when Android’s growth rate is literally an order of magnitude higher.</p>\n<p>Results from other countries show local variations on a similar pattern.  Android is hammering the snot out of its competitors everywhere.  The main difference from the U.S. is that while iOS is still posting tiny share gains here, it’s getting badly hurt elsewhere.  In France it has actually lost 23% of share in the last year!  It’s hardly doing better in Great Britain; -16%.</p>\n<p>There are fewer surprises in the analysis above the table.  “The key underlying trend is that Android is growing in every country,” said Dominic Sunnebo, described as “consumer insight director” for Kantar.  He zeroes in on the Android army’s faster OODA loop and ability to place lots of different product bets at different price and capability points – quite a familiar theme to readers of this blog.  He also identifies low Android cost as a major sales driver outside the developed world.</p>\n<p>In a recent post I projected that serious zero-sum competition between Android and Apple wouldn’t begin until at least 3Q2011 after Android has chewed up the market share of all the soft targets – RIM and Microsoft, most notably. Kantar’s non-US figures give us a foretaste if what that’s going to be like, and they suggest that I may actually have <em>overestimated</em> Apple’s ability to retain share under Android pressure. It looks as though the disruptive collapse of iPhone has arrived in Europe.</p>\n<p>The figures also point an increasingly bleak picture for the NoWin alliance, which has failed to stop both Nokia and Microsoft from incurring severe losses in market share.  It is beginning to look as though the earliest possible time Nokia could ship WP7-based smartphones is going to be well after Android has achieved a strong supermajority. Since the minority competitor seems certain to be Apple, it’s difficult to locate a plausible point of entry for NoWin phones.</p>"

(even though I don't have yet any DX11\ngames). Had to run a rc kernel for a while, which didn't happen in\nrecent times, but Linux still works nicely (and remember to update the\nfirmware embedded in kernel if you change the GPU!).

      "direction" : "ltr",
      "content" : "<p>I’ve now had a Sony Ericsson Xperia X10 for almost two months <a href=\"http://etbe.coker.com.au/2011/02/18/xperia-x10i-first-experience/\">(here is a link for my first review) [1]</a>. This is a phone that people seem to really dislike because the battery life is poor and Sony doesn’t allow replacing the kernel. I’m happy with mine, happy enough that after buying one for my wife and trying it out I bought one for myself. I knew about it’s problems in advance and wanted a relatively cheap phone with a large high resolution screen, and the Xperia X10 was the best match for my criteria.</p><h3>Charging</h3><p>There has been a recent trend towards using USB for charging devices. Sony provides a tiny wall-wart PSU which has a USB socket and a short (1m) USB cable that can be used to charge the phone from it’s PSU or from a PC. The size is really convenient, as the phone has a short battery life I’ll probably want to take the PSU to more places than I would for other phones I’ve owned.</p><p>The short USB cable saves weight and tangle when travelling, but can be inconvenient. I’m currently working on the phone while it’s plugged into my laptop, that works well and I can make calls while it’s connected. If the phone was connected to a USB port on a tower computer that was on the ground then the cable could be too short to make a call, if it was charging on a power point near the floor then I wouldn’t even be able to use the computer functionality let alone make calls without kneeling. My Viewty has a 175cm charging cable which alleviates these problems. I’ve got a 50cm USB extension cable that I use for charging my phone while I’m in bed – that is just long enough to allow me to check my email without getting out of bed!</p><p>The socket for connecting the USB cable is protected by a plastic lid that is connected by a strip of rubber. For a socket that will be used at least twice a day this isn’t a good mechanical design. The plastic slide on the LG U990 Viewty seems like a much better design.</p><p>As an aside it’s a pity that they aren’t designing cars with USB charging sockets built in. Some new cars have a socket for one USB flash drive to be attached to the radio, but really they need at least one USB charging port per seat. It would also be nice if they made power points with USB charging sockets built in, I’d buy a few of those if they made them.</p><h3>Preserving the Battery</h3><p>I’ve been running “Juice Defender” to reduce the battery use, at the moment it is claiming to have extended battery life by 69%. That combined with turning off things that aren’t needed (such as WiFi) has made the phone reasonably usable. I can survive more than 12 hours during which I use the phone a lot without charging it.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.xperiax10.net/2010/08/02/mugen-power-xperia-x10-battery-review-%E2%80%93-part-1/\">XperiaX10.net has an interesting review of replacement batteries [5]</a>. I’m not going to buy them because the largest battery requires a replacement back case which prevents using an external case to prevent damage and the smaller one doesn’t provide enough of a benefit – and the design of the phone makes it difficult to change batteries so carrying a spare battery isn’t a good option.</p><h3>Cursor Control Keys</h3><p>The HP/Compaq iPaQs that I own from ~10 years ago have a single button that can be moved up/down/left/right to act as a cursor, it can also be pressed inwards to act as an ENTER key (or whatever the application might want for a fifth function). Having some sort of hardware cursor control is really handy, I often end up deleting several characters when I want to replace one because getting the cursor onto the desired character is too difficult.</p><p>Adding more hardware keys would require making the phone bigger, but that would be fine by me. <a href=\"http://etbe.coker.com.au/2010/11/26/quality-of-cameras-in-phones/\">As described in my previous post about phone cameras I’d like to have a phone that’s thicker to have a better camera with a greater focal distance for a larger lens [2]</a>.</p><h3>Core Phone Functionality</h3><p>I really miss having separate green and red buttons for making/answering calls and for rejecting/ending calls.</p><p>A really common operation is to call back the last person who called. To do this on my LG U990 Viewty I press the green button twice on my home screen which took less than a second. On the Xperia this involves selecting the phone icon from the home screen, then the “call log” icon, then the call that is desired, then the “Call user” line. That is four presses in different parts of the screen compared to pressing the same hardware button twice. I’m investigating dialer applets right now, the “<b>Dialler One</b>” applet has a good interface for calling people who have called or been called recently – but it still requires two presses on different parts of the screen. With my old Viewty I could call back the last person by feel without even looking at the phone!</p><p>In the last 6 years the standard functionality of phones has been to include multiple profiles for noises. My Viewty has profiles named “Normal”, “Silent”, “Vibrate only”, “Outdoor”, “Headset” (automatically selected when a headset is connected), and three “customised” ones. The Xperia has only one setting, and that is three icon presses away from the home screen. It does allow changing the volume by hardware switches on the side which includes going to vibrate-only and silent mode. While this is useful, it’s not the best way that two precious hardware keys could be used. It also doesn’t allow control over all the different notifications, I’d like to be able to activate a noise profile and have every application respond to it in an appropriate manner. This is a deficiency in Android 2.1 not in the phone itself.</p><p>In many ways this phone has the worst phone functionality of any mobile phone I’ve ever owned, I think that this is more the fault of the Android designers than Sony Ericsson.</p><h3>Android Updates</h3><p>Sony had previously claimed that they wouldn’t support Android later than 2.1. <a href=\"http://blogs.sonyericsson.com/products/2011/03/25/update-on-xperia%E2%84%A2-x10/\">Now Sony has announced that they will support “Gingerbread” – Android 2.3 [3]</a>. So one of the major complaints about the Xperia will soon be addressed.</p><h3>Tethering</h3><p>The build of Android that the Xperia runs at the moment doesn’t support Wifi tethering. I’m currently using with <a href=\"http://www.mobile-stream.com/easytether/android.html\">Easy Tether for USB tethering [4]</a>. It’s not free software and requires it’s own code to run as root on your Linux system that is being tethered (which is easily locked down with SE Linux), but it basically works. The down-side with Easy Tether is that it proxies all the connections so you can’t run traceroute etc and in the free version you can’t use UDP.</p><h3>K9 Mail</h3><p>K9 Mail fixes some of the problems in the default Android email program that I described in my previous post. It allows selection of SSL with a default port of 993 for IMAPs. It uses mail.example.com as the mail server address for an email address of user@example.com (so I’ll add a “mail” CNAME to the domains I run). When I connected initially it told me that the SSL key was not signed by a CA and asked if I wanted to save it or reject it – this is the correct and desired functionality. It also correctly parses URLs from the email (or at least has fixed the bug that I discovered in the default email app).</p><p>One problem I’ve found with K9 is that it seems to timeout on large folders. This is probably partly the fault of Virgin Mobile being slow for IP access, but I wonder whether K9 doesn’t pipeline IMAP commands as Virgin can do bulk transfer at reasonable speeds (80KB/s) and it mainly fails on latency (900ms being typical). The result is that a folder with more than 500 messages that need to be copied to the phone will never get synchronised. When I started reading mail on my phone I had to move mail from some of the bigger folders into other folders to avoid timeouts. As an aside the amount of time I’ve saved by reading email on the go has already paid for the phone.</p><h3>Mediascape</h3><p>The Sony Mediascape software is used for categorising photos. One function of this is to assign names to photos, the names come from the contact list so if you photograph someone who you can’t phone then you need to add a contact list entry for them. This also means that you couldn’t conveniently add names to non-humans, I guess I could have added a contact list entry “Mr Crash Dump” for photos of system crash logs. But a bigger problem is that it decides what is a picture of a person, a picture of someone who is not centered in the photo or a profile picture can be regarded as not a photo of a person and therefore not subject to being associated with a contact list. Finally when selecting a name for a picture it displays the entire contacts list in a small font instead of displaying favorites, I have the phone numbers of many clients in my contacts list who I will never photograph…</p><p>Mediascape just isn’t much good. If I feel the need to do something serious in this regard I’ll search the app store for something free that’s better.</p><h3>Protection</h3><p>For $15 each I bought one grey and one clear “Gel Case” from <a href=\"http://www.j2k.com.au/\">J2K</a>. This case covers the sides and back of the phone with a firm rubber layer that will hopefully allow it to bounce rather than break. It also extends slightly higher than the screen which should stop the screen being scratched if the phone is left face-down on a hard surface on the vibrate setting.</p><p>One problem with the Gel Case is that by it’s design it has to cover the buttons on the sides, due to a design or manufacturing problem the clear case that my wife uses can press slightly on the shutter button which disables the three main buttons on the front. So when the menu or back button stops working she has to slightly move the Gel Case out from the side. I’m thinking of just cutting out a section of the Gel Case there, that will make it difficult to press the shutter button, but you can use the touch screen to take photos and there doesn’t seem to be any other use for the shutter button so this shouldn’t be a problem. The clear and grey cases have different designs, the grey one has a hole over the raised Sony logo which makes it fit a little better as well as not having the shutter problem, so it seems to be a later design – I don’t know whether all clear cases have the same problem but I recommend that someone who only has one Xperia X10 get the grey case just in case.</p><h3>Web Browsing</h3><p>I’m experimenting with using my own web proxy to compress the data sent to the phone. Unfortunately the Android settings for a web proxy only apply to the main web browser, not to all the other applications that use web services. Also the built-in web browser requires pressing the “settings” hardware button followed by at least two touch-screen presses to change between windows or close a window and it doesn’t seem to support making the short-press action be to open a link in a new window. So I will have to find another web browser to use.</p><h3>Bandwidth Use</h3><p>The “3G Watchdog” applet is really good for tracking the data transfer and optionally cutting off 3G access before the quota is exceeded. Unfortunately Virgin has already sent me a bill with $234 in extra charges for bandwidth use because I used 1.6G instead of my 1.5G quota. A Virgin representative had told me over the phone that the billing period would be based on the end of the month, so while every calendar month has had less than 1.5G used because I used more than average in the end of March and the start of April that counts as excess data in the 14th March to 13th April period.</p><p>I’m going to appeal this to the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman, I don’t think that it’s reasonable that I should be billed almost 7* the normal bill for exceeding the quota by 7.4% based on following the instructions of a Virgin employee. While I could have read the previous bill that they sent me to discover the end of billing period dates, I don’t think that I should be expected to distrust everything that a Virgin employee says. If they billed me an extra $20 then I’d just pay it, but $234 is unreasonable.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Since using the phone I’ve found significant benefits in web browsing and reading email with the major limitation being the small screen (relative to a Netbook or Laptop). So if I was to buy another phone I would probably consider a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell_Streak\">Dell Streak</a> which seems to be the largest Android phone on the market at the moment.</p><p>Given the amount of use that I’ve got I would be happy to spend more money and therefore consider a more expensive phone. But I don’t regret the decision to save money by getting an Xperia X10.</p><p>Finally when a telco tries to stick me with a $234 excess charge it really detracts from the value of having a phone contract. If I end up having to pay that then it’s half the value of a smart-phone lost in one telco scam. This is enough to make a contract with Virgin a bad option, after this contract expires I may use VOIP and a pre-paid SIM from Telstra NextG if their network is still the best. Another possibility is to just use a small tablet and skip having a mobile phone, email and Jabber plus SMS from the people who lack net access will probably do.</p><ul><li>[1]<a href=\"http://etbe.coker.com.au/2011/02/18/xperia-x10i-first-experience/\"> http://etbe.coker.com.au/2011/02/18/xperia-x10i-first-experience/</a></li><li>[2]<a href=\"http://etbe.coker.com.au/2010/11/26/quality-of-cameras-in-phones/\"> http://etbe.coker.com.au/2010/11/26/quality-of-cameras-in-phones/</a></li><li>[3]<a href=\"http://blogs.sonyericsson.com/products/2011/03/25/update-on-xperia%E2%84%A2-x10/\"> http://blogs.sonyericsson.com/products/2011/03/25/update-on-xperia%E2%84%A2-x10/</a></li><li>[4]<a href=\"http://www.mobile-stream.com/easytether/android.html\"> http://www.mobile-stream.com/easytether/android.html</a></li><li>[5]<a href=\"http://www.xperiax10.net/2010/08/02/mugen-power-xperia-x10-battery-review-%E2%80%93-part-1/\"> http://www.xperiax10.net/2010/08/02/mugen-power-xperia-x10-battery-review-%E2%80%93-part-1/</a></li></ul>"

One\nof the complaints I've heard in the past is the lack of support for\nLinux. It's not really relevant to running it on a work desktop (where\nsupport is presumably from some central IT organisation), but I believe\nit's a red herring. Support in the Free software world can exceed that\nin the proprietary by an impressive margin. And that <em>can</em> turn out to\nbe useful at work, even if you do suppose the existence of central IT.</p>\n\n<p>The support I've received for Linux and applications under it has been,\non numerous occasions, excellent in a way I feel I could never expect\nfrom the commercial software world. And when it isn't, I have the choice\nof whomever I want to try and fix my problems, rather than being stuck\nwith no options.</p>\n\n<p>I have found that if I am polite, and provide useful information, and\npatient, I can talk directly to the developers who make the software I\nuse. If I have a patch they will often take it from me, or use it as a\nbasis for the final fix. If they are no longer available, or too busy,\nthen because I have the source I can find someone else to look at the\nproblem, or do so myself.</p>\n\n<p>The chances of most large proprietary software companies giving me the\ntime of day is low. I don't understand why small businesses think that\nWindows is a safer choice due to being able to get support from\nMicrosoft.</p>\n\n<p>Again using experience gained at Black Cat, at one point we had a\nproblem with IPv6 routes being updated. Signs pointed to Quagga, Simon\ncollected relevant information and got in contact with the Quagga devs.\nThey investigated, realised it wasn't a problem with their code, and\nthen proceeded to find the issue in the Linux kernel, produce the fix\nand pass it upstream. Within hours of us reporting the problem. I'll\naccept that's an exceptional response that can be matched within the\nproprietary software world, but not without a hefty support contract and\nI doubt you would have got a response other than \"Not our fault, talk to\nthe other supplier\", or maybe a workaround at best.</p>\n\n<p>More recently, I had a conversation about Linux and discard support, with one of the people who'd worked on it. Very interesting from my PoV, useful to my work (I ended up fixing something in our code base that led to the Linux support Just Working with our product) and I believe was useful to that developer too, in terms of providing some insight to the other side of the problem. I don't get that kind of access to proprietary software developers - while it could be argued that I know a lot of Free software people, I also know a lot of other programmers and they're just not able to be so open about things, so both sides lose out.</p>\n\n<p>Or my new laptop's ethernet wasn't supported by the kernel in squeeze. I filed a bug requesting the driver be added (and pointing to the patch). The week I wrote the first draft of this article I saw confirmation that this had been done, and will be part of the final squeeze release. I think that's pretty impressive. (Thanks, Ben.)</p>"

      "content" : "<p>Our team has grown up a little and we started to make things faster.</p>\n<h3>External projects</h3>\n<p>First, our friends in <a href=\"http://www.yandex.ru/\">Yandex</a> open-sourced FCGI management daemon: <a href=\"https://github.com/golubtsov/Fastcgi-Daemon\">fastcgi-daemon</a><br>\nIt allows a rapid deployment of C++ FCGI applications and has flexible configuration and management tools.<br>\nKudos to Ilya Golubtsov and Vasily Kiritsev from Yandex team.</p>\n<p>The first external <a href=\"http://www.ioremap.net/projects/elliptics\">elliptics</a> application is <a href=\"https://github.com/lmovsesjan/elliptics-fastcgi\">HTTP proxy</a> written on top of fastcgi-daemon by Leonid Movsesjan from Yandex team.<br>\nSource code contains example configs, which allow to read/write/delete data, get direct link to the object on the server in cluster, which can be streamlined or downloaded directly by client.<br>\nIt easily handles 1000 random read RPS being connected to 2 elliptics nodes, where each request is handled just within tens of milliseconds. And although data set is not very large (just hundreds of thousands of small files from 10 to 50 kbytes each), it is still a spectacular number.</p>\n<h3>Datacenters</h3>\n<p>in a meantime our production clusters grew up. We will get first abroad datacenter this year, which will host content for international users. This cluster currently hosts about 150 millions of rather small objects (10-50 kbytes each) with 3 copies in physically distributed datacenters.<br>\nOur second production cluster comes close to half-petabyte scale (4 datacenters, about 200 elliptics nodes), its network load reaches 3.5 gbit/s daytime, although this scale took a fair technical price - we had to rewrite IO model again.</p>\n<h3>IO thread models</h3>\n<p>We recently switched IO model in elliptics core from thread-per-client to single network IO thread, which implements non-blocking reactor, and pool of disk IO threads. Elliptics maintains O(1) lookup times which implies that every node knows about every other, which in turn requires N^2 network connections in cluster and thus the same number of IO threads in thread-per-client model.<br>\nFor 200 nodes this is 4k threads/connections, each machine with 24 disks starts 24 elliptics nodes, ending up with almost 100.000 sockets and threads in peaks. Linux just can not start that much threads by default (we used 2.6.32 and .38 kernels) on 64-bit servers with 24 Gb of RAM.<br>\nAnd even if we tune some things, it will stop at 500 nodes limit and so forth. Eventually this is a dead end.</p>\n<p>Now we use IO thread pool and network processing thread, which handles sockets via <code>epoll()</code>. We dropped <code>libevent</code> and friends, since it is still extremely unconvenient and ugly to add events from one thread into other's processing loops.</p>\n<h3>Future plans</h3>\n<p>We started to think about secondary indexes in elliptics network. We can easily build slow-enough map-reduce-like processing on top of our data, but for example it will not quickly return prefix-search data, although we can run brute-force regex-like search.</p>\n<p>I will continue PAXOS implementation - we do want to build Chubby-like service for small synchronized data storages as well as locks and counters. Combined with elliptics it should provide a full operation stack for data storage.</p>\n<p>POHMELFS is not dead, IT IS NOT DEAD, please remember this :)<br>\nI'm just a little bit busy with things.</p>\n<p>I think about dropping transactions support in elliptics and always perform rewrite-in-place. Ext* filesystems live without this feature compared to Btrfs and everyone is happy. Well, this is a cool feature, but hardly needed for everyone.</p>\n<p>Hmm, I bought myself a small Yamaha KX-49 MIDI-keyboard and it even works in Linux with Rosegarden (modulo non-working controls) and continue to play trumpet, but this is another story.<br>\nI will try to post more regulary here, although most of the time twitter wins :)</p>"

This is a package that contains 2 extremely\nimportant debhelper packaging tools for packaging Mono/CLI related packages\ncalled <a href=\"http://git.debian.org/?p=pkg-cli-common/packages/cli-common.git;a=blob;f=dh_makeclilibs;hb=HEAD\">dh_makeclilibs</a> and <a href=\"http://git.debian.org/?p=pkg-cli-common/packages/cli-common.git;a=blob;f=dh_clideps;hb=HEAD\">dh_clideps</a>. If you don't know these, they\ndo exact the same thing as dh_makeshlibs and dh_shlibdeps do. dh_makeclilibs\ngenerates library dependency tracking information and dh_clideps consumes\nthat information to automatically generate the package dependencies for\nyou. So each library of the 4.0 runtime profile has now it's own package,\nsimple as that, the rest does cli-common-dev for me and you.</p>\n\n<p>\"Hey, that Mono packaging bastard is polluting the Debian archive because of\nhis laziness!\" No, I am not. This packaging change not only has the advantage\nof simplifying the packaging and with that bringing new Mono versions faster\nto you but also reduces the typical install size for applications as they will\nonly pull in the really used libraries of Mono instead of groups of them. I\ndon't have any numbers handy right now as none of the applications are built\nagainst Mono 2.10 (yet), but when the transition starts we will get numbers.</p>\n\n<h2>New Features</h2>\n\n<p>There is also a new SGen flavor of Mono available called <a href=\"http://packages.debian.org/search?searchon=names&amp;keywords=mono-runtime-sgen\">mono-runtime-sgen</a>\nwhich is no longer using the conservative non-generational <a href=\"http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Hans_Boehm/gc/\">Boehm's garbage\ncollector</a> but <a href=\"http://www.mono-project.com/Compacting_GC\">SGen</a> which is a simple generational garbage collector with\n<a href=\"http://developers.sones.de/2010/09/01/taking-the-new-and-shiny-mono-simple-generational-garbage-collector-mono-sgen-for-a-walk/\">promising advantages</a>.</p>\n\n<p>And here some more Mono 2.8/2.10 news from\n/usr/share/doc/mono-runtime/NEWS.Debian.gz:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>SGen Precise Stack Scanning</li>\n<li>Enhanced SIMD with new methods for Vector data type conversions and\nswapping elements in vectors</li>\n<li>ASP.NET MVC 3.0 (not included, only supported)</li>\n<li>The C# Interactive Shell can now be used as shebang: #!/usr/bin/csharp</li>\n<li>.NET 4.0 runtime</li>\n<li>C# 4.0 compiler</li>\n<li>ASP.NET 4.0</li>\n<li>Managed Extensibility Framework (MEF)</li>\n<li>System.Data.Services.Client (OData)</li>\n<li>glib was replaced with eglib</li>\n<li>Removed .NET 1.1 runtime</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Architecture Regressions</h2>\n\n<p>With the initial upload of Mono 2.10.1 to Debian/Experimental the architecture\nworld broke apart and it <a href=\"https://buildd.debian.org/status/logs.php?pkg=mono&amp;ver=2.10.1-1\">regressed</a> on all Mono architectures except for\ni386 and amd64 <img src=\"http://www.meebey.net/tags/planet-debian/../../smileys/biggrin.png\" alt=\":-D\"> There is a reason it's called <em>experimental</em> isn't there?</p>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://buildd.debian.org/status/logs.php?pkg=mono&amp;ver=2.10.1-3\">mono 2.10.1-3</a> I could solve all regressions except for kfreebsd-*\nand armel. <a href=\"http://apebox.org/\">Jo Shields</a> fixed the remaining regressions and the world\nstarted to look good again in <a href=\"https://buildd.debian.org/status/logs.php?pkg=mono&amp;ver=2.10.1-4\">mono 2.10.1-4</a>! He also took care of\n<a href=\"http://packages.qa.debian.org/m/mono-basic/news/20110409T221714Z.html\">mono-basic</a>, mod-mono and xsp, but mod-mono and xsp are still waiting for\nthe <a href=\"http://lists.debian.org/debian-l10n-basque/2011/04/msg00001.html\">translation call deadline</a> to pass by so they can also be uploaded\nto Debian/Experimental.</p>\n\n<h2>Planned Transition</h2>\n\n<p>As mentioned above, there will be a Mono 2.10 transition needed when the\npackages hit Debian/Unstable. There is no ETA yet on this when it will happen\nas I have to coordinate this with debian-release first. But as things are not\nshowtime ready in experimental anyhow, this will not happen too soonish. The\nMono 2.10 transition plan will be covered in a following post.</p>\n\n<h2>GIVMENOWPLX</h2>\n\n<p>OMG, all this rumbling about Mono 2.10 and I still haven't said a word on\nhow to obtain it, sorry about this, just do this and I will shut up now:</p>\n\n<pre><code>echo &quot;deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian experimental main&quot; &gt;&gt; /etc/apt/sources.list\napt-get update\napt-get install -t experimental mono-complete\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>(this is the easiest way of getting only mono 2.10.1 from experimental)</p>"

Yep, the forthcoming Rails 3.1 is going to be bringing in a few new friends as dependencies: <a href=\"http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/\">CoffeeScript</a>, <a href=\"http://jquery.com/\">jQuery</a>, and <a href=\"http://sass-lang.com/\">Sass</a>. What does this mean? Why has this been controversial? I'm going to quickly run through the details here.</p>\n<h3>jQuery - A Non-Controversial Switch</h3>\n<p>It was back in March (2011) when David Heinemeier Hansson, creator of Rails, dropped an interesting nugget of info on Twitter:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.rubyinside.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/to1.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"to1\" width=\"645\" height=\"185\"></p>\n<p>A lot of Rails applications lean on JavaScript to provide client-side and AJAX functionality. Till now, the <a href=\"http://www.prototypejs.org/\">Prototype</a> library had been included in Rails by default as a way to make various things easier to achieve across different browsers, but <a href=\"http://jquery.com/\">jQuery</a> has become significantly more popular over the last few years.</p>\n<p>Given this, DHH's announcement passed with little controversy since Rails developers had become used to using jQuery and installing the <a href=\"https://github.com/indirect/jquery-rails\">jquery-rails</a> gem anyway. A good move and a progression with the times - awesome.</p>\n<h3>CoffeeScript - JavaScript, Improved</h3>\n<p>Today's news:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.rubyinside.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/to2.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"to2\" width=\"644\" height=\"185\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/\">CoffeeScript</a> started life as a Ruby project that converted a cleaner, JavaScript-esque language <em>into</em> JavaScript (<a href=\"http://www.rubyinside.com/coffeescript-a-new-language-with-a-pure-ruby-compiler-2921.html\">we covered it in January 2010</a>). CoffeeScript's syntax enables you to write JavaScript in a cleaner and, often, more logical way.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.rubyinside.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/cofeescriptdemo.gif\" alt=\"\" title=\"cofeescriptdemo\" width=\"640\" height=\"485\"></p>\n<p>The project eventually became self hosting (so no Ruby was required) and has gone from strength to strength. While regular JavaScript doesn't have to worry about losing many developers any time soon, CoffeeScript has become a popular way to write JavaScript code in a tighter, easier to follow form amongst more progressive developers.</p>\n<p><em>Trivia: The creator of CoffeeScript, Jeremy Ashkenas, was inspired by Marc Andre Cournoyer's <a href=\"http://8dc2fg6673tfx6f6ea1yt90uf1.hop.clickbank.net/\">Create Your Own Programming Language e-book.</a> Yes, I make a small commission on this. If I get enough to build a mansion, I'll have your name etched into the cornerstone.</em></p>\n<h3>Sass - CSS, Improved</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://sass-lang.com/\">Sass</a> is to CSS as CoffeeScript is to JavaScript, though to a less extreme level. In its modern form, Sass looks just like CSS but adds support for things like variables, functions, nesting, and similar useful features. Crucially, Sass is just a <em>superset</em> of CSS so you can still use regular CSS with Sass and it'll Just Work™. You can then learn new features one by one and start using them as you like (I must admit, I'm a massive fan of Sass and I mostly stick to the variables and nesting features).</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.rubyinside.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/sasscss.gif\" alt=\"\" title=\"sasscss\" width=\"438\" height=\"230\"></p>\n<h3>Controversy - Bullpoop, Same Old</h3>\n<p>In true Ruby and Rails style, there's been a little controversy over today's CoffeeScript and Sass news. While the jQuery migration was pretty much accepted due to Prototype's position six feet under, plenty of developers are familiar with JavaScript and either feel slighted by CoffeeScript's inclusion as a default or are concerned that it'll act as a barrier for newcomers to Rails in future.</p>\n<p>Given that you can \"opt out\" of having CoffeeScript and Sass included in your Rails projects by making a minor change to your Gemfile, this faux-controversy is nowhere near as interesting to me as the legitimate <a href=\"http://www.rubyinside.com/dhh-offended-by-rspec-debate-4610.html\">RSpec vs Test::Unit debate</a> that DHH kicked off.</p>\n<p>However, if you want to grab some popcorn and enjoy the bullshit, the comments <a href=\"https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/9f09aeb8273177fc2d09ebdafcc76ee8eb56fe33\">on this GitHub commit page</a> are epic. People have even gone so far to produce graphics to express their opinions. Rock and roll. There's also a <a href=\"http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%22rails+3.1%22+OR+%22coffeescript%22+OR+dhh\">significant level of pie-slinging going on on Twitter</a> too.</p>\n<h3>But what about HAML!?</h3>\n<p>It had to be asked right?</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.rubyinside.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/to3.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"to3\" width=\"640\" height=\"157\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.rubyinside.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/to4.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"to4\" width=\"644\" height=\"162\"></p>\n<p>Phew!</p>\n<p>Last but not least:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.rubyinside.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/to5.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"to5\" width=\"645\" height=\"185\"></p>\n<p>I'm glad David's stepping into these sorts of discussions again. He seemed to fade away during the year before Rails 3 came out, leaving a lot of the \"thought leadership\" to Yehuda Katz. Now he's back on top form and talking sense - long may it last.</p>\n<h3>UPDATE: Wanna play with Rails 3.1 and CoffeeScript right away?</h3>\n<p>Oh, and do you actually <a href=\"http://www.rubyinside.com/how-to-rails-3-1-coffeescript-howto-4695.html\">want to play with Rails 3.1 RIGHT NOW?</a> You can - just click that link. I already wrote a tutorial post about it.</p>\n<div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RubyInside?a=OTCT3W-rEDM:o6KLvjR0ODE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RubyInside?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RubyInside?a=OTCT3W-rEDM:o6KLvjR0ODE:3H-1DwQop_U\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RubyInside?i=OTCT3W-rEDM:o6KLvjR0ODE:3H-1DwQop_U\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/RubyInside/~4/OTCT3W-rEDM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

      "content" : "<p>Fairness is always difficult. It is often impossible to achieve in systems where many people make multiple choices. Kenneth Arrow won a Noble Prize in economics, and has an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impossibility_theorem\">Impossibility Theorem</a> named after him for his work showing how ranked voting systems are impossible to make inherently fair. More precisely his theorem says that when a voting system is trying to rank 3 or more candidates that it cannot optimize different aspects of voting fairness at once.  It's sort of like the old proverb \"fast, cheap, good -- pick any two\" because you can't optimize all three. Mathematically when more than 3 candidates are being ranked in a vote some aspect of fairness -- either ensuring that each vote has similar weight, or that each outcome has a similar chance of happening or some other criteria of ranking fairness -- must be infringed.</p>\n\n<p><img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"http://www.kk.org/thetechnium//project-triangle.png\" alt=\"Project triangle\" border=\"0\" width=\"320\" height=\"314\"></p>\n\n<p>Every search algorithm, which is another way of ranking choices, is likewise inherently unfair to some of the sources it is ranking. It does not matter whether the search engine is Bing, Ask, Google, or one not yet invented, a ranking of page results cannot be fair in every dimension of fairness.  It will be biased in some way, just as every voting system is biased in certain directions.</p>\n\n<p>Nonetheless, we want fairness. Neutrality. Search is both an essential service in our lives today, and also a very big business. News, commerce, identity, and indirectly the principles of freedom flow through the tools of search engines. Their power can be misused. We've seen that in China, and we can imagine it in theory. If a search algorithm is inherently biased, is there a way to establish or mold it to be more neutral?</p>\n\n<p>There are many, many people upset with the dominant search engine, Google. They see the biased nature of search. Some are <a href=\"http://www.searchneutrality.org/\">business people</a> whose livelihood was affected by Google's algorithms; others are activists, pundits, or academics concerned with Google's dominance. <a href=\"http://james.grimmelmann.net/\">James Grimmelmann</a> has rounded up the  best arguments for establishing \"neutrality\" in search in a very long, very clear, (and very skeptical) <a href=\"http://james.grimmelmann.net/essays/SearchNeutrality#manipulation\">technical paper</a>. He distills the arguments into eight proposed <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_neutrality\">search-neutrality</a> principles:</p>\n\n<blockquote>1. Equality: Search engines shouldn’t differentiate at all among websites.\n\n<p>2. Objectivity: There are correct search results and incorrect ones, so search engines should return only the correct ones.</p>\n\n<p>3. Bias: Search engines should not distort the information landscape.</p>\n\n<p>4. Traffic: Websites that depend on a flow of visitors shouldn’t be cut off by search engines.</p>\n\n<p>5. Relevance: Search engines should maximize users’ satisfaction with search results.</p>\n\n<p>6. Self-interest: Search engines shouldn’t trade on their own account.</p>\n\n<p>7. Transparency: Search engines should disclose the algorithms they use to rank web pages.</p>\n\n<p>8. Manipulation: Search engines should rank sites only according to general rules, rather than promoting and demoting sites on an individual basis.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>These seem very reasonable expectations to me. Then Grimmelmann throws his grenade:</p>\n\n<blockquote>As we shall see, all eight of these principles are unusable as bases for sound search regulation.</blockquote>\n\n<p>He tries to clarify again:</p>\n\n<blockquote>Just because search neutrality is incoherent, it doesn’t follow that search engines deserve a free pass under antitrust, intellectual property, privacy, or other well-established bodies of law. Search engines are capable of doing dastardly things: According to BusinessWeek, the Chinese search engine Baidu explicitly shakes down websites, demoting them in its rankings unless they buy ads. It’s easy to tell horror stories about what search engines might do that are just plausible enough to be genuinely scary. My argument is just that search neutrality, as currently proposed, is unlikely to be workable and quite likely to make things worse. It fails at its own goals, on its own definition of the problem.</blockquote>\n\n<p>He then refutes each point, which I summarize here:</p>\n\n<p>1. Equality -- \"Of course Google differentiates among sites -— that’s why we use it. Systematically favoring certain types of content over others isn’t a defect for a search engine—it’s the point.\"</p>\n\n<p>2. Objectivity -- There is none. \"Search users are profoundly diverse. They have highly personal, highly contextual goals. One size cannot fit all.... Who is to say that Yahoo! was right and Google was wrong? One could equally well argue that Google’s low ranking was correct and Yahoo!’s high ranking was the mistake.\"</p>\n\n<p>3. Bias -- The entire web is biased. \"Search SEO, link farms, spam blog comments, hacked websites — you name it, and they’ll try it, all in the name of improving their search rankings. A fully invisible search engine, one that introduced no new values or biases of its own, would merely replicate the underlying biases of the web itself: heavily commercial, and subject to a truly mindboggling quantity of spam.\"</p>\n\n<p>4. Traffic -- There should be no right to traffic or placement for an incumbent site. If the engine judges the site is not desirable to its users it can change its ranking. \"Just as the subjectivity of search means that search engines will frequently disagree with each other, it also means that a search engine will disagree with itself over time.\"</p>\n\n<p>5. Relevance -- Search engines increase relevance to users by making subjective choices, downgrading or upgrading sites based on what they think their users want, not what the sites want. \"Search engines compete to give users relevant results; they exist at all only because they do.\"  Outside of users, relevance is hard to define and harder to prove, and not useful.</p>\n\n<p>6. Self-interest -- Very possible; sometimes happens. Monopolistic self-dealing behavior is also very plausible. \"Search-engine critics argue that search engines should disclose commercial relationships that bear on their ranking decisions. This is a standard, sensible policy response.\" But says Grimmelmann \"This isn’t a neutrality principle, or even unique to search; it’s just a natural application of a well-established legal norm.\"</p>\n\n<p>7. Transparency -- The sentiment is good, but execution is problematic. If the algorithm is wholly transparent it will be gamed by spammers or worse and rendered useless. If transparent to regulators, they are unlikely to adapt fast enough to bless innovations. \"Everything will hinge on their own ability to evaluate the implications of small details in search algorithms. The track record of agencies and courts in dealing with other digital technologies does not provide grounds for optimism on this score.\"</p>\n\n<p>8. Manipulation -- Seems bad, but \"all search results are manipulated and the more skillfully the better.\" What everyone is rightly concerned about is \"hand manipulation\" or manual intervention, or special treatment. \"Google itself is remarkably coy about whether and when it changes rankings on an individual basis.\" Should spammers get \"special treatment\"? \"Prohibiting local manipulation altogether would keep the search engine from closing loopholes quickly and punishing the loopholers.\"</p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, Grimmelmann declares the impossibility theorem. Search engines favor users over websites, and to some (websites) that may seem unfair.</p>\n\n<blockquote>Search neutrality gets one thing very right: Search is about user autonomy. A good search engine is more exquisitely sensitive to a user’s interests than any other communications technology.....Having asked the right question—are structural forces thwarting search’s ability to promote user autonomy?—search neutrality advocates give answers concerned with protecting websites rather than users. With disturbing frequency, though, websites are not users’ friends. Sometimes they are, but often, the websites want visitors, and will be willing to do what it takes to grab them.</blockquote>\n\n<p>Google is not neutral. And it can never be, nor Bing or any search engine. As long as Google favors the user over the commercial interests of websites, and as long as they are reasonable in bridling their own commercial self-interests in favor of the user, then their non-neutrality will keep them going, and keep us happy.</p><p><iframe src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~ah/f/hhtodjhmb4g922okahkj5r5k0c/468/60#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.kk.org%2Fthetechnium%2Farchives%2F2011%2F04%2Fno_search_neutr.php\" width=\"100%\" height=\"60\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\"></iframe></p><div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/thetechnium?a=s-yu4jhVjLk:DtkXDAvxKbI:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/thetechnium?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/thetechnium/~4/s-yu4jhVjLk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

Held in co-location with the Linux Foundation Collaboration Summit, more than 45 free software developers joined the camp, participating at 16 interesting talks. I will highlight some of the interesting topics, including a link to all the recorded talks.</p>\n<p>Jim Zemlin from Linux Foundation had an excellent talk on The State of the Linux Union. He explained where Linux has expanded or even sky rocketed in market shares the last decade. He spoke about how Linux has gained +90% market share in high performance computing and dominating shares on embedded systems and smart phones. It’s about future Internet and cutting R&amp;D cost by reusing Linux and other open source products. In the talk, Jim also points out how Linux is redefining personal computing, and the move to services.</p>\n<p><span></span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Thiago Macieira explained the Qt Open Governance progress and how the development of Qt is moving to open governance. People are welcome to join. The process will be fair, transparent, inclusive and meritocratic. It’s about enabling the community to assure its needs are met. Thiago explained the workflow, tooling, the decision making model and roles. There are also interesting questions on how how to bootstrap the open governance operation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As usual, there are a lot of good technical talks at Camp KDE. Of the talks I saw, I can recommend Ariya Hidayat talking on efficient graphics with Qt and Romain Pokrzywka talking on Kontact Touch on mobile.

Two readers sent in their versions of the tokenisers (ps, put a link to your home work results from Part One in the comments, and I'll link to it here). <ul><li><a href=\"http://pastebin.com/P0sXjr65\">http://pastebin.com/P0sXjr65</a></li><li><a href=\"http://gist.github.com/460197\">http://gist.github.com/460197</a></li></ul>    <br><br><h3>Our simple tokeniser</h3><pre>operators = ['/', '+', '*', '-']<br>class ParseError(Exception):<br>    pass<br>def is_operator(s):<br>    return s in operators<br>def is_number(s):<br>    return s.isdigit()<br><br>def tokenise(expression):<br>    pos = 0<br>    for s in expression.split():<br>        t = {}<br>        if is_operator(s):<br>            t['type'] = 'operator'<br>            t['value'] = s<br>        elif is_number(s):<br>            t['type'] = 'number'<br>            t['value'] = float(s)<br>        else:<br>            raise ParseError(s, pos)<br> <br>        t.update({'from': pos, 'to': pos + len(s)})<br>        pos += len(s) + 1<br>        yield t<br></pre><pre><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; pprint(list(tokenise(&quot;1 + 2 * 4&quot;)))<br>[{'from': 0, 'to': 1, 'type': 'number', 'value': 1.0},<br> {'from': 2, 'to': 3, 'type': 'operator', 'value': '+'},<br> {'from': 4, 'to': 5, 'type': 'number', 'value': 2.0},<br> {'from': 6, 'to': 7, 'type': 'operator', 'value': '*'},<br> {'from': 8, 'to': 9, 'type': 'number', 'value': 4.0}]<br></pre><br><h3>Code for shitjs.</h3>You can follow along with the code for shit js at: <ul><li><a href=\"http://pypi.python.org/pypi/shitjs\">http://pypi.python.org/pypi/shitjs</a></li><li><em>pip install shitjs</em></li><li><a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/illume/shitjs\">https://bitbucket.org/illume/shitjs</a></li><li><em>hg clone https://illume@bitbucket.org/illume/shitjs</em></li></ul>  After you have installed it, shitjs.part1 is the package for the part1 homework.  <h3>What next?  Parsing with the tokens of our simple expression.</h3>Since we have some tokens from the input, we can now move onto the parser.  Remember that we are not making a parser for all of javascript to start with, we are starting on a simple expressions like \"1 + 2 * 4\".  As mentioned in Part One, we are using an algorithm called \"Top Down Operator precedence\".  Where actions are associated with tokens, and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_operations\">an order of operations</a>.  Here you can see the precedence rule (order of operations) with parenthesis around the (1 + 2) addition changes the result. <br><pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; 1 + 2 * 4<br>9 <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; (1 + 2) * 4<br>12 </pre><br>A number is supplied for the left, and the right of each token.  These numbers are used to figure out which order the operators are applied to each other.   So we take our token structure  from tokenise() above, and we create some Token objects from them, and depending on their binding powers evaluate them.  <br><br><h3>What's new is old is new.</h3>  <img src=\"http://www.ukgirlthing.co.uk/Content/ProductImages/4382/images/0001.jpg\" border=\"0\"><br>The \"Top Down Operator precedence\" paper is from the 70's.  In the 70's lisp programmers loved to use three letter variable names, and therefore the algorithm and the variable names are three letter ones.   They also wore flares in the 70's (which are back in this season) and I'm not wearing them, and I'm not using three letter variable names!   <br><br>Sorry, I digress...   So we call 'nud' prefix, and 'led' infix.  We also call rbp  right_binding_power, and lbp left_binding_power.     <br><br>nud - prefix     <br>led - infix     <br>rbp - right_binding_power     <br>lbp - left_binding_power  <br><br>Prefix is to the left, and infix is to the right.   <br><br><h3>Manually stepping through the algorithm.</h3>  Let's manually step through the algorithm for the simple expression \"1 + 2 * 4\". <br><pre><br>    &gt;&gt;&gt; pprint(list(tokenise(&quot;1 + 2 * 4&quot;)))<br>    [{'from': 0, 'to': 1, 'type': 'number', 'value': 1.0},<br>     {'from': 2, 'to': 3, 'type': 'operator', 'value': '+'},<br>     {'from': 4, 'to': 5, 'type': 'number', 'value': 2.0},<br>     {'from': 6, 'to': 7, 'type': 'operator', 'value': '*'},<br>     {'from': 8, 'to': 9, 'type': 'number', 'value': 4.0}]<br></pre><br><br>Let's give left binding powers to each of the token types. <ul><li>number - 0</li><li>+ operator - 10</li><li>* operator - 20</li></ul> Ok, so first we have a number token, with the value of 1.0.  This is because in our shitjs so far all numbers are floats.  Here is a log obtained by stepping through the expression.<br><pre>('token', Literal({'to': 1, 'type': 'number', 'value': 1.0, 'from': 0}))<br>('expression right_binding_power: ', 0)<br>   ('token', OperatorAdd({'to': 3, 'type': 'operator', 'value': '+', 'from': 2}))<br>   ('left from prefix of first token', 1.0)<br>   ('token', Literal({'to': 5, 'type': 'number', 'value': 2.0, 'from': 4}))<br>   ('expression right_binding_power: ', 10)<br>       ('token', OperatorMul({'to': 7, 'type': 'operator', 'value': '*', 'from': 6}))<br>       ('left from prefix of first token', 2.0)<br>       ('token', Literal({'to': 9, 'type': 'number', 'value': 4.0, 'from': 8}))<br>       ('expression right_binding_power: ', 20)<br>           ('token', End({}))<br>           ('left from prefix of first token', 4.0)<br>           ('leaving expression with left:', 4.0)<br>       ('left from previous_token.infix(left)', 8.0)<br>       right_binding_power:10: token.left_binding_power:0:<br>       ('leaving expression with left:', 8.0)<br>   ('left from previous_token.infix(left)', 9.0)<br>   right_binding_power:0: token.left_binding_power:0:<br>   ('leaving expression with left:', 9.0)<br></pre><br><br><br>You can see that it is a recursive algorithm.  Each indentation is where it is entering a new expression.<br><br>Also, see how it manages to use the binding powers to make sure that the multiplication of 2 and 4 is done first before the addition.  Otherwise the answer might be (1 + 2) * 4 == 12! Not the correct answer 9 that it gives at the end.<br><br>The operations are ordered this way because the + operator has a lower left binding power than the * operator.<br><br>You should also be able to see from that trace that a tokens infix and prefix operators are used.  The OperatorAdd for example, takes what is on the left and adds it to the expression of what is on the right with it's prefix operator.<br><br><br>Here is an example Operator with prefix(left) and infix(right) methods.<br><br><pre>class OperatorAdd(Token):<br>    left_binding_power = 10<br>    def prefix(self):<br>        return self.context.expression(100)<br>    def infix(self, left):<br>        return left + self.context.expression(self.left_binding_power)<br></pre><br><br>Pretty simple right?  You can see the infix method takes the value in from the left, and adds it to the expression of what comes on the right.<br><br><br><h3>Exercises for next time</h3> Make this work:<br><pre><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; evaluate(&quot;1 + 2 * 4&quot;)<br>9.0<br></pre><br>(ps... if you want to cheat the code repository has my part 2 solution in it if you want to see.  The code is very short).<br><br><br><h3>Until next time... Further reading (for the train, or the bathtub). </h3> <img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v30/kiyone/ami-mizuno-sailor-mercury-reading.jpg\" border=\"0\"><br>Below is some further reading about parsers for JavaScript, and parsers in python. <ul><li><a href=\"http://simpleparse.sourceforge.net/\">simpleparse</a> and <a href=\"http://blog.dowski.com/2010/07/21/a-json-parser-using-simpleparse/\">a json parser using simpleparse</a>.</li><li><a href=\"http://jaredforsyth.com/blog/2010/jul/8/announcing-codetalker/\">codetalker</a></li><li><a href=\"http://jaredforsyth.com/blog/2010/jul/17/comparing-parser-generators-python/\">comparing python parser generators</a></li><li><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus%E2%80%93Naur_Form%20\">Extended Backus–Naur Form (EBNF)</a></li></ul>   After following some of those links you may realise that we could probably make this shitjs interpreter in an easier way by reusing libraries.  However if we wanted to do that, we'd just use an existing JavaScript implementation!

Almost two years ago to the day, GitHub <a href=\"https://github.com/blog/411-github-issue-tracker\">launched an issue tracker</a>. Some people love it, some people hate it — but let's not focus on the past (we're living in the future so the present is our past). Let's talk about the version of Issues that launches today.</p>\n\n<h3>Anatomy of an issue</h3>\n\n<p>Let's start with what an Issue is. <a href=\"http://github-images.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/2011/issues-next/sample-issue.png\">Here's a screenshot of a GitHub Issue</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://github-images.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/2011/issues-next/sample-issue.png\"><img src=\"https://d3nwyuy0nl342s.cloudfront.net/img/0457951fc4c4aefa35a88efe67fe47cc8f9b0385/687474703a2f2f6769746875622d696d616765732e73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f626c6f672f323031312f6973737565732d6e6578742f6f70656e696e672d626c6f636b2e706e67\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Starting off you'll get an overview of the Issue's state, who's been working on it and what it's all about.</p>\n\n<h4>Assign, add to a milestone and attach labels</h4>\n\n<p>One of the hardest challenges in issue management is organizing and finding the issues you want to work on.  You've always been able to add labels to an issue, but now you can <strong>assign</strong> someone to the issue and add it to a <strong>milestone</strong>.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://d3nwyuy0nl342s.cloudfront.net/img/ec0267f7ae8bdbe7b6bda78c356be5bba565e8dd/687474703a2f2f6769746875622d696d616765732e73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f626c6f672f323031312f6973737565732d6e6578742f6f70656e696e672d626c6f636b2d686967686c69676874732e706e67\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>The triforce of labels, assignees and milestones allows you organize issues no matter if you're a workflow-heavy shop or just looking for a quick sortable task list on your personal projects.</p>\n\n<h4>Issue Events</h4>\n\n<p>Whenever someone closes or reopens an issue, we'll show it inline.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://d3nwyuy0nl342s.cloudfront.net/img/3feb114682e7aec6e55ce668b94a36f076d98674/687474703a2f2f6769746875622d696d616765732e73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f626c6f672f323031312f6973737565732d6e6578742f69737375652d6576656e74732e706e67\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<h3>Navigating issues</h3>\n\n<p>Issues 2.0 launches with an issue browsing interface that's simple, responsive, and flexible.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://github-images.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/2011/issues-next/sample-list.png\"><img src=\"https://d3nwyuy0nl342s.cloudfront.net/img/3b7d72d47db2b4fd473fd44a9b9abda3c5efa5ad/687474703a2f2f6769746875622d696d616765732e73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f626c6f672f323031312f6973737565732d6e6578742f6c6973742d707265766965772e706e67\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n\n<p>The list view allows you to quickly filter and find the issues you're looking for.

So I went to the ITU website.  There again a similar story.\nFrom their asn1 website section, you can only get the <a href=\"http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/formal-language/itu-t/q/q773/1997/TCAPMessages.html\">TCAPMessages\nfrom 1997. If you want an older format, like the </a><a href=\"http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-Q.773-198811-S\">Q.773 from 1988</a>, you can\ndownload a PDF file.  Most of that PDF file is actual text.  But the ASN.1\nsections are included as an image, so there is no way how you can copy+paste\nthem.\n</p>\n<p>\nSo there I went, and manually typed in those few pages of ASN.1 source code.\nAfter I was finished,  I thought I had finally done enough.  Writing a\nword-for-DOS parser, typing in pages of ASN.1 manually.  What more can there\nbe? I should be able to finally generate Erlang code for decoding and encoding\nthe respective messages.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut it would be too simple if it was that easy.  The 1988 TCAP as well as the\nold MAP specifications use the ASN.1 \"MACRO\" construct to define the individual\nMAP operations.  However, as it seems the MACRO construct had been deprecated\nin 1994 by the ISO  in charge of ASN.1.  Successive ISO specs for ASN.1\nhave completely remove the MACRO construct as similar results can be achieved\nwith newly-introduced <i>information objects</i>. So of course, the Erlang\nasn1ct (as well as other free software ASN.1 tools) does not support such an\nantique feature.\n</p>\n<p>\nSo here I am in the year 2011, unable to use information available in the\npublic ITU-T and ETSI/3GPP specifications to build a GSM MAP protocol\nimplementation that can deal with the messages that you encounter on real-world\nSS7 links.  I guess there are now the following different approaches to proceed:\n</p><ul>\n<li>write a converter that translates MACRO into OBJECT</li>\n<li>manually convert the old MAP specs from MACRO to OBJECT</li>\n<li>add MACRO support to current-day ASN.1 tools</li>\n<li>find some old ASN.1 code generators that still support MACRO</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nAll in all, this is a really dissatisfying situation, and I would say it is a\nfailure of the standardization bodies to provide useful versions of their\nspecifications.  You cannot remove operations and associated message types from\na specification, while in real life even 15 years later a whole number of users\nstill use messages according to those (now removed) definitions.  Meanwhile, the\nold specs are getting useless, because you not only deprecate but completely\nremove a language construct of the formal specification language used.\n</p>\n<p>\nThis renders the idea of having a formal specification useless.  If I first\nneed to write my own converters or manually convert that very same formal\nspecification, errors can be introduced in the translation/conversion process,\njust as much as errors could have been introduced in manually writing encoding\nand decoding routines based on a non-formal-specified protocol like most of the \nIETF / Internet protocols.\n</p>"

The Russian Security service has been reported to have called for a ban on Skype, Hotmail and Gmail citing those services as a possible threat to national security. Apparently because the Federal Security Service has no access to the data on these servers that are hosted out of the country, they can’t monitor every conversation that goes on and because of that they fear it will be used for malicious purposes. While this ban might help stop the bad guys from communicating through those services, there are so many alternative email and VoIP services that aren’t based in Russia either – how are they going to stop that? Such reasoning doesn’t make any sense, and there could possibly be another motive not brought forward. In any case, the FSB will be coming up with a plan on how to regulate the use of encryption technology that will be ready by October 1.

      "content" : "<img src=\"http://planet.debian.org/heads/rhonda.png\" width=\"89\" height=\"84\" alt=\"\" align=\"right\" style=\"float:right\">  <h4>The Background</h4>\n\n<p>If you weren't online last Friday you probably have missed the big news announcement on the <a href=\"http://www.archlinux.org/news/the-canterbury-project/\">various</a> <a href=\"http://www.debian.org/News/2011/20110401\">community</a> <a href=\"http://blog.grml.org/archives/352-The-Canterbury-Project.html\">distribution</a> <a href=\"http://news.opensuse.org/2011/04/01/the-canterbury-distribution/\">websites</a>. The main pages of them got replaced by <a href=\"http://www.debian.org/misc/canterbury\">a placeholder</a> announcing the birth of The Canterbury Project. People started to wonder whether it is an April fool's prank or for real. This blog post is meant to shine a bit more light on it and address one comment received about it.</p>\n\n<p>If you go to the <a href=\"http://www.debian.org/News/2011/20110401\">news item on the Debian site</a> you'll get your answer about that it indeed was an April fool's prank. The idea for doing something in coordination with other distributions came to me when I thought about last year's (or was it already two year's ago?) prank that the various web cartoon sites pulled: they replaced their main page with the page of another cartoonist. My original idea was actually along that lines. So I started to dig up website contacts from different distributions, I was aiming at the big names in the community distribution sector.</p>\n\n<p>Given that my time is pretty limited these days with renovating the house we plan to live in soonish I knew I had to let in others in within Debian. I though didn't want to involve too many people, for several reasons: it should be a surprise to as many as possible, but more importantly, I didn't want to shy away other distributions by an overwhelming Debian involvement. That's also part of the reason why I didn't contact many Debian based distributions.</p>\n\n<p>So first contacts where made, a dedicated IRC channel used for coordination, and people involved joined in. Then the thing happened which the Free Software community is so well known for: additional ideas came in, two people independently addressed me whether it wouldn't be better that instead of a circle replacement of the frontpage, why not display the same page on all of them. And one of them added that a corresponding news item might make sense.</p>\n\n<p>So there we were, having to think about text to put into two things: the news item and the replacement page itself. At this stage Alexander threw in a project <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_Fools%27_Day\">name with a background</a> that was adopted. Francesca started with an idea for the news item, I started to put quotes in and asked for ones from the other involved people that fit their distribution well. Klaas came up with a template for the replacement page that we tweaked. Fortunately we ended up being five distributions and the colors of the banner did match the distribution ones rather well (except for one, we had to tweak the color of one banner).</p>\n\n<h4>The Credits</h4>\n\n<p>We were all set, and actually everything went fine. And it definitely caught the attention. This blog post goes out in thanks to the following people:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>For <a href=\"http://www.archlinux.org/\">Arch Linux</a>: Pierre Schmitz and Dieter Plaetinck—thanks for joining in on such a short notice!</li>\n  <li>For <a href=\"http://www.debian.org/\">Debian</a>: Alexander Reichle-Schmehl (thanks for the name!), David Prévot, Francesca Ciceri (thanks for gathering contact information!) and Martin Zobel-Helas (thanks for webserver setting tweaks).</li>\n  <li>For <a href=\"http://www.gentoo.org/\">Gentoo</a>: Robin H. Johnson—thanks for the best quote for the news item!</li>\n  <li>For <a href=\"http://www.grml.org/\">Grml</a>: Michael Prokop—thanks for the great live CD and your input!</li>\n  <li>For <a href=\"http://www.opensuse.org/\">openSUSE</a>: Thomas Schmidt and Klass Freitag—thanks for the perfect website theme and the best mocked up news item!</li>\n  <li>... and most of all, to the to be left unnamed person from the distribution that didn't join in in the end: a lot of thanks has to go in that direction because of the invaluable input. The actual idea about the additional news item is to be accounted to that person, and the Canterbury logo was tweaked there too.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I hopefully haven't forgotten anyone. There surely were some more people involved in the other distributions, and I guess the named people weren't aware of all the ones involved inside Debian. Feel free to drop missing names in the comments.</p>\n\n<h4>Addressing Feedback</h4>\n\n<p>Finally, let me address one concern raised: someone claimed that the real joke with this prank was that we would consider collaboration to be a joke. Actually, the total opposite is the case here. That it was possible to pull it off should be proof enough that <q>Collaboration Across Borders</q> actually is possible. And the background information put into the news section of the replacement site is real. Also, my personal quote in the news item was meant dead honest. I <strong>do</strong> believe that DEX has a limited point of view and only tackles part of the problem.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, for such efforts to really come to life it takes people with a really long breath and dedication to it. Efforts like the <a href=\"http://vcs-pkg.org/\">VCS-PKG</a> and the <a href=\"http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Games\">Freedesktop Games</a> effort are more or less stalled. Even though a lot of people do believe in stronger collaboration to be a good thing, the basis is not working out too well. I'm in the fortunate position that for some of the packages I maintain there is exchange between packagers from different distributions to avoid common troubles. If it can't be done in the big it should at least be tried in the small.</p>\n\n<p>I want to specifically highlight again one part of the updates in the replacement page: the <a href=\"http://fosdem.org/2011/schedule/track/crossdistro_devroom\">CrossDistro track at this year's FOSDEM</a>. This one was more than fruitful, on several levels. From what I've heard a lot of discussion happened besides the talks too, and connections got established. It doesn't sound unlikely like this might be done again next year.</p>\n\n<p>So again, thanks for enjoying this April fool's prank, thanks to everyone who helped to deliver it, and especially a lot of thanks to the people who this might have got thinking of possibilities to improve on the collaboration front!</p>\n\n<p align=\"right\">\n  <i><a href=\"http://rhonda.deb.at/blog/debian\">/debian</a> | \n    <a href=\"http://rhonda.deb.at/blog/debian/the-canterbury-project.html\">permanent link</a> |\n    <a href=\"http://rhonda.deb.at/blog/debian/the-canterbury-project.html\">Comments: 8</a> |\n    <a href=\"http://flattr.com/thing/46312/Rhondas-Blog\">Flattr this</a></i>\n</p>"

The evidence can be seen in the grim picture below.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"http://torrentfreak.com/images/capitoltape.jpg\" alt=\"Capitol\"></center></p>\n<p>“This is something I have seen and known about and lived with for 20 years. It has to be stopped,” said rising country music star Johnny Cash. “I’m concerned with the moral issue here. Record piracy is no better than counterfeiting $100 bills….or rustling cattle.”</p>\n<p>Cash’s paymasters in the country music industry agree that the solution definitely lies in the toughing up of legislation. Following a period of lax legislation, recently Tennessee became the first state where the piracy of music became a felony and now there are nearly eight others.</p>\n<p>Penalties are getting harsher too and now range from $100 to $5,000 but according to the industry, that’s not enough. Indeed, Cash has been publicly supporting a bill by two congressmen that would impose fines of $50,000 and jail terms of up to 3 years for music piracy. But not everyone is happy with the approach.</p>\n<p>“These proposed fines are absolutely crippling and a totally over the top reaction,” said a spokesman for TapeFreak, a small newspaper that reports on music piracy issues.</p>\n<p>“In 30 to 40 years people will look back on these fines and wonder why there wasn’t more public outrage. If people don’t speak out now who knows where we will end up.”</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://torrentfreak.com/images/statelaw.jpg\" align=\"right\" alt=\"statelaw\">But it seems that harsher fines in one area simply causes a relocation of the problem. According to Joe Smith, President of Warner Bros, when certain states adopt tougher penalties, pirates simply move to another.</p>\n<p>“State laws would be OK if all 50 states had laws, but they don’t,” says Smith. “I remember one case about two years ago when Tennessee passed a strict law and a big pirate there just moved to Selma, Al., where he was welcomed by the Chamber of Commerce for bringing a new industry into town.”</p>\n<p>TapeFreak’s spokesman says that legislation isn’t the answer and that pirates will always find a way to continue – particularly if they get access to new technology.</p>\n<p>“I know it sounds unlikely but what if in the future pirates find a way to duplicate music at negligible costs, maybe by making tapes spin round more quickly? The problem could escalate overnight and who knows what might come along next,” he said.</p>\n<p>But the problem isn’t only making the copies. TapeFreak says there’s a real possibility that the postal service will get their act together in the next few years and become really efficient with their deliveries. Once tapes can be shipped around in double quick time – perhaps even further afield outside the US – the problem might not remain localized. It could even become a worldwide issue.</p>\n<p>“What is the music industry going to do then – open every package and envelope and look inside? I don’t think so. It would take too much time and besides, people would go crazy,” he added.</p>\n<p>Stephen Neary of IFPI maintains that the solution to these possible but unlikely future events lies in legislation. To this end his organization is waging a worldwide campaign to persuade governments to introduce and enforce tougher copyright laws. He held up Hong Kong as a shining example of what could be done and told the Sarasota Herald Tribune that “you’d be very lucky” to find pirated music there.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://torrentfreak.com/images/relieved.jpg\" align=\"right\" alt=\"relieved\">While tackling large scale pirates is one thing, going after individuals is something else altogether. A spokesman from Capitol Records is pessimistic.</p>\n<p>“You’re never likely to stop the little guy,” he explained. “Just like they never stopped people making bootleg liquor in their bathtubs.”</p>\n<p>However, if teenagers in bedrooms were the only threat, executives at Capitol, Columbia, RCA and other record companies would breathe a sigh of relief. They have bigger fish to catch and are making significant progress in doing so.</p>\n<p>As this article was going to press, it became apparent that the United States government had incredible news for the music industry following their intense lobbying efforts. According to yesterday’s article in the New York Times – <a href=\"http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0B13F73A5413728DDDAE0894DA415B888BF1D3\">dated 7th December 1978</a> – more than 300 FBI agents have seized $100 million worth of modern sound-recording equipment.</p>\n<p>Officials said the raids “wiped out 50 percent” of the illicit recording industry in the United States, which is obviously very encouraging news. Considering the industry’s moves to have harsh legislation put in place in all 50 states, it must follow that getting rid of the remaining 50% is just a raid or two away.</p>\n<p>Couple this with a replication of IFPI’s Hong Kong successes in other countries around the world and music piracy will almost certainly become a thing of the past, probably in a matter of a few years.</p>\n<p>Of course, there’s always the possibility that some new newfangled device will come along to stir things up, but rest assured, the music industry are no fools. They won’t be fighting this war in another 30 years.</p>\n<p>The law will see to that.</p>\n<p><em>Comments from TapeFreak aside (forgive us a little artistic license), every person, every event and every quote referred to in this article is entirely genuine.

I started using standard keyboards in a different fashion, not putting so much stress on my wrists (and on the muscles connecting them to the rest of the body, of course): I exclusively use US keymaps (with some modifications to allow for proper Spanish input and ﬀŭₙṅý characters), but instead of making the middle row my fingers' home row, I type with the base position of my fingers in a V shape — Fingers resting on (approx.) w-e-f-v-spacebar and spacebar-m-l-;-]; the fingers doing most of the travelling are the index and middle, and with no straining for the little fingers to reach ` or backspace. On the other side, the most straining keys become Control and Shift, which requires closing the hands a bit too much, but are not <em>that</em> bad. My way <em>does</em> induce some new kind of stress, as my arms also have to move to reach 6 and 7, but it... Works for me™.</p>\n<p>It looks weird and is somewhat strange to get used to, but I must say it has worked great for me.

It’s been split in\nseveral repositories: one for the core protocol/library\nimplementation; one for the demo compositor and clients.</li>\n<li><em>Easy?</em> Not quite, <code>mesa</code> needs to be rebuilt against the\nlibrary. Doing so on a system running <code>stable</code> doesn’t seem too\ngood: some newer libraries might be needed; and using <code>make\ninstall</code> could make it harder to remember additional bits installed\nall over the place (<code>$DESTDIR</code> is our friend but that might mean\nmore work on the build system side to get everything\ndetected).</li>\n<li>What about having the whole development environment running in a\n<a href=\"http://lxc.sourceforge.net/\">Linux container</a>? That’s what I\ninvestigated.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Giving Linux containers a try</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Start from a <code>squeeze</code> system.</li>\n<li><code>apt-get install lxc</code>, read its <code>README.Debian</code>, get the mount\npoint set up.</li>\n<li>Copy the <code>/usr/lib/lxc/templates/lxc-debian</code> template somewhere as\n<code>lxc-squeeze</code>, and edit it:\n<ul>\n<li>Replace <code>dhcp-client</code> with <code>dhcp3-client</code>.</li>\n<li>Replace <code>lenny</code> with <code>squeeze</code>.</li>\n<li>Specify a better mirror than <code>ftp.debian.org</code>.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Create a <code>lxc-test</code> directory, and create a container:\n<code>./lxc-squeeze -p lxc-test</code>.</li>\n<li>Start the container, which gives access to a console: <code>lxc-start -n\ntest -f lxc-test/config</code> (the <code>test</code> name passed through <code>-n</code> can\nbe used to call <code>lxc-stop -n test</code>). Use <code>root</code>/<code>root</code> to get in.</li>\n<li>Edit <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code> to point to <code>sid</code> instead, and\ndist-upgrade (using <code>squeeze</code> to start with means fewer headaches\nwhile bootstrapping, in case <code>sid</code> breaks or gets into some\ntransition).</li>\n<li>Try <code>lxc-stop</code> and <code>lxc-start</code> to make sure the container can be\nstopped and restarted at will.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Getting devices</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>First things first (and unless I missed something), <code>udev</code> + LXC =\nfail. So let’s install it, note that it can’t be configured, edit\n<code>/var/lib/dpkg/info/udev.postinst</code>, add <code>exit 0</code> at the top, and\n<code>dpkg --configure udev</code>.</li>\n<li>Now, some devices are needed under <code>/dev</code>. Using <code>mknod</code> would be\ntoo easy, that’s called a <strong>container</strong> for a reason. So let’s edit\nthe <code>config</code> file (the one passed to <code>lxc-start</code> earlier) to add a\nfew devices (see below for an example).</li>\n<li>Once that done, restart (<code>lxc-stop</code>/<code>lxc-start</code>) the container,\n<code>mknod</code> on those devices is now possible.</li>\n<li>Input devices are not considered here, only video output is wanted\nfor this test case. [This post might be edited if some examples\nget added later.]</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>Example, with a Radeon card, KMS enabled, let’s assume those devices\nare wanted:</em></p>\n\n<pre><code>crw-rw---- 1 root video 226, 0 Apr  5 02:34 /dev/dri/card0\ncrw-rw---- 1 root video  29, 0 Apr  5 02:34 /dev/fb0\ncrw------- 1 root root    4, 7 Apr  5 02:34 /dev/tty7\ncrw------- 1 root root    4, 8 Apr  5 02:34 /dev/tty8\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><em>Note the major, minor right between owner groups and dates, and edit\nthe <code>config</code> file accordingly, adding those lines (watch the syntax,\nit doesn’t like extra whitespaces):</em></p>\n\n<pre><code>lxc.cgroup.devices.allow = c 226:0 rwm\nlxc.cgroup.devices.allow = c 29:0 rwm\nlxc.cgroup.devices.allow = c 4:7 rwm\nlxc.cgroup.devices.allow = c 4:8 rwm\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><em>Once the container restarted, create the devices:</em></p>\n\n<pre><code>cd /dev\nmkdir -p dri\nmknod -m 666 dri/card0 c 226 0\nmknod -m 666 fb0       c 29 0\nmknod -m 666 tty7      c 4 7\nmknod -m 666 tty8      c 4 8\n</code></pre>\n\n<h3>Getting serious</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>apt-get install xorg</code></li>\n<li><code>startx</code></li>\n<li><code>strace -f</code> can help diagnose issues. If <code>/dev/dri/card0</code> shows up\nwith <code>ENODEV</code>, an old <code>libdrm</code> could even remove that device, so\nrunning <code>mknod</code> is needed again (but not sufficient)</li>\n<li>A likely cause of such issues might be that an X server already ran\n(or is still running) on the host system. Disabling the display\nmanager on the host, rebooting, and trying <code>startx</code> from the\ncontainer again should give better results (that’s what happened\nhere).</li>\n<li>If <code>startx</code> just works™, just use <code>^Z</code> then <code>bg</code> to put it in the\nbackground.</li>\n<li>Move on to installing a random window manager (<em>e.g.</em> <code>awesome</code>)\nand <code>mesa-utils</code>, and enjoy!</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>Enjoy:</em></p>\n\n<pre><code>export DISPLAY=:0\nawesome &amp;\n# this is not a benchmark:\nglxgears &amp;\n# direct rendering:\nglxinfo|egrep &#39;(direct|renderer)&#39;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><em>which printed here:</em></p>\n\n<pre><code>direct rendering: Yes\nOpenGL renderer string: Gallium 0.4 on ATI RS690\n</code></pre>"

Otherwise, he would have been a target in the “Academic Conference &amp; Consultation” because of his “extreme thinking”. He might also have been demanded to confess: how come he had so much dirty thoughts? Why he resented the rich so much? What his next step was?</p>\n<p><span></span>\n<p>According to the report of the Xi’an Evening News, starting from the beginning of May this year, Beijing University will promote the “Academic Conference and Consultation” system aiming towards ten categories of “Key Students” all across the campus. The ten categories are students with academic difficulty, extreme thinking, who are psychologically fragile, in poverty, frequently change enrollment status, live independently, addicted to Internet, have employment difficulty, suffering from serious disease and rule violators who are under disciplinary actions. Cha Jing, deputy secretary of student affairs office of Beijing University, particularly expressed that besides students with difficulty in their study need to be consulted, some students who constantly exaggerate the small deficiency in school work like “criticizing school randomly just because cafeteria raised the food price by 0.20 yuan”, will also become the target of the consultation and investigation.</p>\n<p>Such a large campus cannot even tolerate a little criticism about the food price increase. The school authority said, “the Conference and Consultation System is mainly aimed at students with academic difficulties.  Actually they “killed two birds with one stone”—— including students with “extreme thinking” also will under their control? More interestingly, “living independently” has also become a crime. Is this a goal of Beijing University’s to teach students to live with strict dependence? Isn’t it targeting “extreme thinking” and “independent living” really meant to target “independent thinkers”? What would principal Cai Yuanpei, who put forward the idea of “all-inclusive and open-minded” have react to this? Maybe all he could have done is just to say,“all mighty student affairs office!” and follow by tears and silence.</p>\n<p>There will be no innovation without freedom of thinking, there will be no free thoughts without inclusiveness towards the so-called “extreme thinking”. If a free space is provided for the “minority”, the world will boast surprises of innovation; if it is shackled, emasculated or even twisted, talents will be made into mediocrities.  Mark Elliot Zuckerberg, who created the most popular social network Facebook in his university days, just intended to provide a platform to chase after girls or contact among dorms. If he was in Chinese universities initiating the creation of Facebook, he would have been regarded as with a bad taste and would be doomed to be the target.</p>\n<p>Here is another example from Beijing University. Zhang Zhongxing, known as masters of Chinese culture together with Ji Xianlin in Beijing University, in his university days, cohabited and had a daughter with 17-year-old Yang Mo——author of “Song of Youth”. Master Zhang’s academic achievement might not be necessarily related to his early unruly behaviors. But a university does not even tolerate students’ complaints about the increased price in the cafeteria is definitely not going to be able to groom masters. Ancient poem goes,“the towering pine trees is now reaching the sky thanks to the grace of the woodchopper. ”But how many big trees would be cut down by today’s “conference and consultation” system of Beijing University?</p>\n<p>Besides, this “extreme gate” scandal in Beijing University has apparently shown the bureaucratization of universities. This “conference and consultation” system has straightly constrained the thinking of students and harmed the soul of Beijing University’s educational liberty. However, it was suggested by the student affairs office, the government of university. Obviously, all things like professors governing universities and intellectual autonomy are all nothing, but floating clouds. Student affairs office is the real deal.</p>\n<p>The bureaucratization of universities turns university officials into risk evaders. That is to say: the achievement of students will not be counted as their contribution, but the trouble they cause will definitely be seen as their fault. Therefore, nine and a half out of ten universities claim “Innovative and realistic” as their school motto, but university officials can seldom tolerate students to “be creative” and making trouble for them. Some extreme thinking will even be investigated and consulted by school, let alone any action.</p>\n<p>“A man’s entire dignity lies in thinking.” In an era without tolerance, without the rights to heresy, without differences, every single one will become pyramid or terra cotta, but never a great thinker or having independent personality.</p>\n<p>Beijing University, who will not tolerate “extremists”, can it still be the nationally admired home of great thinkers? May I ask,who dictates today’s world of Beijing University?</p>\n<div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/ChinaHush?a=XwxsQnmTfOs:U9M7Y4IhN98:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/ChinaHush?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/ChinaHush?a=XwxsQnmTfOs:U9M7Y4IhN98:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/ChinaHush?i=XwxsQnmTfOs:U9M7Y4IhN98:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/ChinaHush?a=XwxsQnmTfOs:U9M7Y4IhN98:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/ChinaHush?i=XwxsQnmTfOs:U9M7Y4IhN98:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/ChinaHush?a=XwxsQnmTfOs:U9M7Y4IhN98:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/ChinaHush?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/ChinaHush?a=XwxsQnmTfOs:U9M7Y4IhN98:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/ChinaHush?i=XwxsQnmTfOs:U9M7Y4IhN98:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/ChinaHush?a=XwxsQnmTfOs:U9M7Y4IhN98:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/ChinaHush?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/ChinaHush?a=XwxsQnmTfOs:U9M7Y4IhN98:KwTdNBX3Jqk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/ChinaHush?i=XwxsQnmTfOs:U9M7Y4IhN98:KwTdNBX3Jqk\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/ChinaHush?a=XwxsQnmTfOs:U9M7Y4IhN98:l6gmwiTKsz0\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/ChinaHush?d=l6gmwiTKsz0\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/ChinaHush?a=XwxsQnmTfOs:U9M7Y4IhN98:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/ChinaHush?i=XwxsQnmTfOs:U9M7Y4IhN98:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/ChinaHush?a=XwxsQnmTfOs:U9M7Y4IhN98:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/ChinaHush?i=XwxsQnmTfOs:U9M7Y4IhN98:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ChinaHush/~4/XwxsQnmTfOs\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"></p>"

Fling cool and shiny Nokia phone and destroy the competition. Complete all free 30 levels and be first to collect all golden Ovi’s by gathering MeeGo and Windows Phone 7 logos in the levels!</p>\n<p>The other game that is sure to be an instant hit among true Nokia fans will be the Nokia Ninja – you are a humble user and sales people are throwing phones at you – all kinds of phones. But beware – most of those phones are not Nokias! Use your finger to slice trough the competition, rake up combos and achievements! But be careful – you do not want to slice trough a Nokia phone! Only trough instant brand recognition you can rake up truly great scores in this game.</p>\n<p>Nokia – connecting people.</p>\n<p>(P.S. Check the date)</p>"

      "content" : "<img src=\"http://planet.debian.org/heads/np237.png\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" alt=\"\" align=\"right\" style=\"float:right\">  <p>There have been a lot of web browsers embedding the Gecko engine, especially through the gtkmozembed “library” (it was not really a proper library but let’s call it like that). I remember being a happy user of galeon, which went on as epiphany, but there were also all these small applications that just need a good HTML renderer in one of their widgets, like yelp, or several Python applications using python-gtkmozembed.</p>\n\n<p>Anyone having had to deal with these applications, especially the most complex ones, could tell you a few things:\n</p><ul>\n<li>the Mozilla developers never gave a friggin’ damn about embedding;</li>\n<li>they don’t know how to develop an easily embeddable library;</li>\n<li>the notion of a stable interface is a very arcane concept that they don’t wish to grasp.</li></ul><p></p>\n\n<p>So, today, it is official: <a href=\"http://www.h-online.com/open/news/item/Mozilla-kills-embedding-support-for-Gecko-layout-engine-1218990.html\">Mozilla is dropping gtkmozembed from their codebase</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I don’t think this will come as a surprise to anyone. You can’t develop a new version of a behemoth, monolithic application every 3 months while still caring about the interfaces underneath. Embedded applications have been migrating to webkit over the recent years, and those that don’t do it really soon will die.</p>\n\n<p>The interesting part of the announcement is not here. It can be found <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=618381\">hidden in a bug report</a>: <b>a stable and versioned libmozjs will just never happen</b>.</p>\n\n<p>What does it mean?</p>\n\n<p>First of all, it means that Debian and Ubuntu will have to go on maintaining their own versioning of libmozjs so that it can be linked to in a decent way by applications using the SpiderMonkey JS engine. It also means that this version will have to be bumped more often.</p>\n\n<p>But it also puts into question the whole future of SpiderMonkey as a separate library. With a shortened release cycle, the Mozilla developers will be tempted to add more specific interfaces to SpiderMonkey, reducing its genericity in favor of its use in Firefox itself. This will produce less and less useful libmozjs versions, until we reach the point when they’ll make the same announcement as above, with s/gtkmozembed/libmozjs/.</p>\n\n<p>This is especially relevant in the context of the <a href=\"http://live.gnome.org/GnomeShell\">GNOME Shell</a>, which is at the core of the GNOME 3 experience. The developers deliberately chose to avoid using JavaScriptCore (the JS library inside webkit) through the Seed engine, and used GJS instead, that relies on libmozjs. In my opinion this was done for frivolous reasons (being able to use more language extensions); and not only this put the GNOME developers in an awkward situation where 2 JS interpreters compete in the same desktop, but now it puts a risk on a technology which is at the core of the desktop.</p>\n\n<p>One of the reasons for the limited adoption of JSCore is that it lies currently in the same library as Webkit, which is a huge dependency. I’ve been very glad to learn that <a href=\"http://blog.kov.eti.br/\">Gustavo</a> is considering the idea of splitting it. We need to provide an escape route for applications using libmozjs, and it looks like more than a decent one. I hope that GNOME Shell follows it sooner than later.</p>"

They claim that a traditional book falls apart after being read 26 times (a claim that Cory disputes based on personal experience working at libraries) and want ebooks to be deleted after being borrowed so often. Really the copy-right fascists are jumping the shark here.</p><p><a href=\"http://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2008/02/26/mental-illness-steals-your-childs-true-self/\">Socialogical Images has an interesting archive of adverts for supposed treatments for autism, obsessive-compulsive disorder, asperger syndrome, and attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder [2]</a>. The New York University Child Study Center conducted the campaign of fake ransom notes to describe a psychological difference as something that kidnaps a child. The possibility that parents should to some extent learn to adapt to their child’s nature rather than fixing them with medication is something that most people can’t seem to understand.</p><p><a href=\"http://scholarcitizen.williamcronon.net/2011/03/15/alec/\">William Cronon has written an interesting analysis of the way “Conservative”, lobby groups work [3]</a>. They are more organised than I expected.</p><p><a href=\"http://blog.reidreport.com/2011/03/when-the-corporation-is-in-charge-japanese-nuke-co-delayed-sea-water-solution/\">The Reid Report has a good summary of some of the corporat issues related to the Japanese nuclear melt-down [4]</a>, apparently the company that runs the reactors decided to delay using sea-water in the hope that their investment could be salvaged and thus put everyone at increased risk. I think that this proves that reactors shouldn’t be privately owned.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theage.com.au/opinion/politics/no-nukes-now-or-ever-20110319-1c1ed.html\">Ian Lowe wrote a good summary of the reasons why Australia should not be using nuclear power when we believed that the Fukushima disaster was over [5]</a>. But it turns out that the Fukushima problems were worse than we thought and the melt-down is getting worse.</p><p><a href=\"http://blog.christophersmart.com/2011/03/22/microsoft-licenses-its-patents-to-android-manufacturers-sues-if-they-dont-agree/\">Christopher Smart wrote a good analysis of Microsoft’s latest attempt to extort money from Linux users where they assert patent claims over Android [6]</a>. He points out that .NET/Mono is a risk to Linux.</p><p><a href=\"http://luv.asn.au/review/snip-burn-solder-shred\">Major Keary wrote a positive review of “Snip Burn Solder Shred” which is a book about “Seriously geeky stuff to make with your kids” [7]</a>. Sounds like a fun book.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2011/03/rsa_security_in.html\">The internal network of RSA has been cracked in some way that apparently weakens the security of SecureID, Bruce Schneier’s blog comments section has an interesting discussion of the possibilities [8]</a>. I expect that it’s a fairly bad attack, if the attack was minor then surely the RSA people would have told us all the details.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_and_the_magic_washing_machine.html\">Hans Rosling gave an interesting TED talk about The Magic Washing Machine [9]</a>. He describes how his family benefited when his mother first got a washing machine and how this resulted in better education as his mother had more time to get library books for her children. It seems that deploying more electric washing machines should be a priority for improving education and food supplies in third-world countries.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/paul_root_wolpe_it_s_time_to_question_bio_engineering.html\">Paul Root Wolpe gave an interesting and disturbing TED talk about bio-engineering [10]</a>. He catalogues the various engineered animals and talks about the potential for future developments.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.slate.com/id/2286735/pagenum/all\">Ron Rosenbaum wrote an interesting and insightful article for Slate about Maj. Harold Hering who’s military career ended after he asked how to determine whether a nuclear launch order is lawful, legitimate, and comes from a sane president [11]</a>. The question never received a good answer, this is a good reason for moving towards nuclear disarmament – and for Americans to vote for the sanest and most intelligent candidate in the presidential elections.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/eythor_bender_demos_human_exoskeletons.html\">Eythor Bender gave an inspiring TED talk about human exoskeletons [12]</a>. He had live demonstrations on stage of a soldier using an exo-skeleton to carry a heavy backpack and a woman who suffered a severe spinal-cord injury walking after being in a wheel-chair for 19 years.</p><ul><li>[1]<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/mar/08/ebooks-harpercollins-26-times\"> http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/mar/08/ebooks-harpercollins-26-times</a></li><li>[2]<a href=\"http://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2008/02/26/mental-illness-steals-your-childs-true-self/\"> http://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2008/02/26/mental-illness-steals-your-childs-true-self/</a></li><li>[3]<a href=\"http://scholarcitizen.williamcronon.net/2011/03/15/alec/\"> http://scholarcitizen.williamcronon.net/2011/03/15/alec/</a></li><li>[4]<a href=\"http://blog.reidreport.com/2011/03/when-the-corporation-is-in-charge-japanese-nuke-co-delayed-sea-water-solution/\"> http://blog.reidreport.com/2011/03/when-the-corporation-is-in-charge-japanese-nuke-co-delayed-sea-water-solution/</a></li><li>[5]<a href=\"http://www.theage.com.au/opinion/politics/no-nukes-now-or-ever-20110319-1c1ed.html\"> http://www.theage.com.au/opinion/politics/no-nukes-now-or-ever-20110319-1c1ed.html</a></li><li>[6]<a href=\"http://blog.christophersmart.com/2011/03/22/microsoft-licenses-its-patents-to-android-manufacturers-sues-if-they-dont-agree/\"> http://blog.christophersmart.com/2011/03/22/microsoft-licenses-its-patents-to-android-manufacturers-sues-if-they-dont-agree/</a></li><li>[7]<a href=\"http://luv.asn.au/review/snip-burn-solder-shred\"> http://luv.asn.au/review/snip-burn-solder-shred</a></li><li>[8]<a href=\"http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2011/03/rsa_security_in.html\"> http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2011/03/rsa_security_in.html</a></li><li>[9]<a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_and_the_magic_washing_machine.html\"> http://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_and_the_magic_washing_machine.html</a></li><li>[10]<a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/paul_root_wolpe_it_s_time_to_question_bio_engineering.html\"> http://www.ted.com/talks/paul_root_wolpe_it_s_time_to_question_bio_engineering.html</a></li><li>[11]<a href=\"http://www.slate.com/id/2286735/pagenum/all\"> http://www.slate.com/id/2286735/pagenum/all</a></li><li>[12]<a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/eythor_bender_demos_human_exoskeletons.html\"> http://www.ted.com/talks/eythor_bender_demos_human_exoskeletons.html</a></li></ul>"

No surprise then that we see the following blog post - <a href=\"http://blogs.enterprisedb.com/2011/03/28/oracle-abandoning-hp-ux/\">Oracle is abandoning HP-UX customers…Fight back!</a> from Ed Boyajian the CEO of EnterpriseDB suggesting that users should consider migrating to their version of PostgreSQL, even though as he admits PostgreSQL has not supported the HP-UX platform very well, but that is now going to change.<br><br>For those who are curious, Firebird V2.5 builds just fine on Itanium HPUX (IA-64). See prefix.hpux_aCC and prefix.hpux_ia64 in the builds/posix directory. The only issue we have in providing such builds, is access to the relevant hardware/operating system to do a build, and bringing upto date the HPUX installer."

It turned out that their public internet had only ports 80 and 443 open so he couldn't do that. He asked me if I could proxy either port 80 or 443 to his server. Surely, I had a solution. I modified the tcp proxy server that I had written for my <a href=\"http://www.catonmat.net/blog/linux-socks5-proxy\">Turn any Linux computer into SOCKS5 proxy in one command</a> article and did:</p>\n<pre>sudo ./tcp-proxy2.pl 443 madars-server.com:22</pre>\n<p>This proxied the port <code>443</code> on my server to <code>madars-server.com</code> ssh port. Now Madars could do</p>\n<pre>ssh -p 443 catonmat.net</pre>\n<p>and he got connected to his server.

If you've talked to me any\ntime in the past couple of weeks and noticed it's a little hard to get me to\nchange the subject, well, that's why.</p>\n\n<p>Many who have grown accustomed to Debian and Ubuntu's lack of support for\ninstalling i386 packages on amd64 (or vice versa) may wonder what the fuss\nis about.  (Whereas others who are well versed in distributions such as Red\nHat and SuSE may laugh and wonder what took us so long...)  So maybe a few\nwords of explanation are in order.</p>\n\n<p>If you've ever installed ia32-libs on an amd64 machine anywhere; if you've\never noticed a bug where ia32-libs didn't work right because of wrong system\npaths, or had to file a request for another library to be added to ia32-libs\nbecause it wasn't included in the set of libraries Debian decided to package\nup in this grotesque, all-in-one 32-bit compatibility bundle; if you've ever\ndecided not to install a 64-bit OS on your perfectly 64-bit-capable hardware\nbecause of concern that you wouldn't be able to run\n$random<em>32-bit</em>only_application; multiarch is for you.</p>\n\n<p>If you've gotten stuck maintaining a lib32foo \"biarch\" package in Debian\ndue to popular demand, multiarch is definitely for you. :)</p>\n\n<p>If you've ever cross-compiled software for a different Debian architecture\nthan the one you were running, multiarch is for you.</p>\n\n<p>If you've ever wanted to run binaries for a different architecture under\nemulation, and found it awkward to set up the library dependencies,\nmultiarch is for you, too.</p>\n\n<p>Because although the .deb world may be a little late to the party, we're\nalso naturally taking things <a href=\"http://lackof.org/taggart/hacking/multiarch/\">much\nfurther</a> than anyone's done\nwith rpm.  Multiarch won't just give you the ability to install 32-bit libs\non 64-bit systems; it'll give you the ability to install libs for any known\narchitecture on any system.  And a whole lot of pain just falls out of the\nequation in the process.  A cross-compiling environment looks the same as a\nnative-compiling environment.  An emulated system looks the same as a native\nsystem.  We can start to seriously consider cross-grading systems from one\narchitecture to another.</p>\n\n<p>And all this is happening now.  The groundwork is there in Ubuntu natty. \nWheezy will be the release that brings multiarch to Debian.  When dpkg\n1.16.0 is uploaded to unstable <a href=\"http://lists.debian.org/debian-dpkg/2011/03/msg00074.html\">real soon\nnow</a>, the\n<a href=\"http://wiki.debian.org/Multiarch/Bootstrapping\">bootstrapping will begin</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I am immensely grateful to everyone who's helped make multiarch a reality -\nto <a href=\"http://err.no/personal/blog/\">Tollef</a>,\n<a href=\"http://lackof.org/taggart/\">Matt</a> and others for seeding the vision;\n<a href=\"http://blog.aurel32.net/\">Aurelien</a>, Matthias and Arthur for their work to\nready the toolchain;\n<a href=\"http://raphaelhertzog.com/2010/12/10/people-behind-debian-david-kalnischkies-an-apt-developer/\">David</a>\nand <a href=\"http://mvogt.wordpress.com/\">Michael</a> for the apt implementation;\nGuillem and <a href=\"http://raphaelhertzog.com/\">Raphael</a> for the dpkg\nimplementation, and <a href=\"http://www.linaro.org\">Linaro</a>'s support to help make\nthis possible; and the many other developers who've helped to refine this\ndesign over the years in numerous other BoFs, sessions and mailing list\nthreads.</p>\n\n<p>I'm excited to find out what the Debian community will do with multiarch now\nthat it's upon us.  Christian, maybe you should start a pool for how long it\nwill take before all the libraries shipped in ia32-libs have been converted\nto multiarch and we can drop ia32-libs from the archive?</p>"

Yup, it’s back, sorry it was away so long.</p>\n<p>In this week’s issue: SMBIOS, Lazy patch checking, and farewell to APM.</p>\n<p>SMBIOS vs. DMI. SMBIOS has long since replaced the DMI specification (the last update to DMI was apparently in 2003), but the kernel is still DMI-centric, having been overloaded to understand various parts of SMBIOS. This is a trend that has been going on for some time, but it finally annoyed Prarit Bhargava enough to want to do something about it – he proposes various changes to expose SMBIOS data directly in sysfs in a thread entitled “SMBIOS: Add initial code and export version via sysfs”. Alan Cox was keen to retain backward compatibility and preserve the same userspace API, even if the actual data being provided came from SMBIOS rather than legacy DMI. (disclaimer: I discussed this with Prarit as part of a separate issue).</p>\n<p>Lazy Patch checking. Sarah Sharp hit upon a common problem when cleaning up existing code. Checkpatch would report an error on lines exceeding 81 characters in length, even though she didn’t write the original code. To make such review and improvement work less cumbersome, Sarah adds a “–lazy” flag to checkpatch.pl to change the return code on such errors. She notes she’s “not a perl hacker”, which is of course not a failing.</p>\n<p>Farewll APM. Len Brown posted a feature-removal-schedule update that will plan the removal of “APM” power management in 2.6.40. It’s been a long time since ACPI and its kin killed off the need for APM on modern systems. Apparently, Microsoft pulled this support in 2006, so 5 years later is probably more than sufficient for Linux systems(!).</p>\n<p>In this week’s pull requests for the 2.6.39 merge window:</p>\n<p>* Stefan Richter requested Linus pull some firewire updates, including an ALSA bug fix.</p>\n<p>* Jean Delvare requested Linus pull some hwmon subsystem updates, including support for two new devices (ADS1015, and SMSC SCH5627).</p>\n<p>* Alex Elder requested Linus pull some XFS updates.</p>\n<p>* Michal Marek requested Linus pull some kbuild updates (v2).</p>\n<p>* Ingo Molnar requested Linus pull some x86 fixes.</p>\n<p>* Miklos Szeredi reqested Linus pull some fuse updates.</p>\n<p>* Pekka Enberg requested Linus pull some SLAB changes that include SLUB lockless fastpath patches from Christoph Lameter.</p>\n<p>* Sage Weil requested Linus pull some Ceph and RBD updates, including “support for an object watch/notify framework that allows and RBD block device to get/send notifications about snapshot creation”.</p>\n<p>* Dave Airlie requested Linus pull some drm fixes, including “One radeon, 2 core fixes, and an interface update to allow for 2 &gt; crtcs in vblank”.</p>\n<p>* Takashi Iwai requested Linus pull some sound fixes for VIA HD audio codes, and “a few other small fixes”.</p>\n<p>* Samuel Ortiz requested Linus pull some MFD fixes, including MFD cell sharing support, and new drivers for TI’s TPS6105x, Maxim MAX8997, STE AB8500 GPADC, and Intel’s Tunnel Creek).</p>\n<p>* Roland Dreier requested Linus pull some infiniband fixes.</p>\n<p>* J. Bruce Fields posted some nfsd changes, including a new interface from Kevin Coffman to allow userspace to query for enctype support.</p>\n<p>* Al Viro posted some vfs and procfs fixes, including fixes for “dumb leaks in path_lookupat() and a large pile of procfs fixes”.</p>\n<p>* Phillip Lougher requested Linus pull some squashfs updates, including support for reading compression options out of the filesystem.</p>\n<p>* Florian Tobia Schandinat posted some viafs cleanup patches.</p>\n<p>* Colin Cross posted some ARM Tegra updates.</p>\n<p>* Len Brown requested Linus pull some ACPI patches, and some idle patches.</p>\n<p>* Mike Frysinger requested Linus pull some changes for blackfin.</p>\n<p>* Mauro Carvalho Chehab requested Linux pull some drivers/media updates, which includes the addition of the “Media Controller API”, required to “adjust stream parameters on SoC media devices”.</p>\n<p>* Alasdair Kergon requested Linus pull some device-mapper patches.</p>\n<p>* Artem Bityutskiy stated he had found “a couple of brown-paperbag bugs”, so posted a second UBI/UBIFS pull request to take care of the matter.</p>\n<p>* Anton Vorontsov requested Linus pull some battery fixes.</p>\n<p>* Ted Ts’o requested Linus pull some ext4 updates.</p>\n<p>* Trond Myklebust requested Linus pull some NFS client changesets.</p>\n<p>* Martin Scheidefsky requested Linus pull some s390 patches.</p>\n<p>* Ingo Molnar requested Linus pull some core kernel, IRQ, perf, and x86 fixes.</p>\n<p>* Thomas Glexiner requested Linus pull some additional IRQ cleanups. These included code for architectures which Ingo considers “orphaned”, but Ingo had done some cross-building at least to check they still build.</p>\n<p>* Jesse Barnes requested Linus pull some PCI fixes.</p>\n<p>* James Bottomley requested Linus pull some “final SCSI updates”.</p>\n<p>In this week’s miscellaneous items:</p>\n<p>* Amerigo Wang posted a patch implementing “acpi_addr” kernel command line handling for passing the ACPI RSDP structure (pointer) into kdump kernels. Cong Wang suggested that this be renamed acpi_rsdp instead.</p>\n<p>* Shawn Guo posted some patches to SDHI support to take driver specific bits out of sdhi-pltfm.c and “make them self registered”.</p>\n<p>* Joseph Cihula posted a patch disabling Intel VT-d Protected Memory Regions (PMRs) when the kernel has been launched with TXT (trusted execution).</p>\n<p>* Tony Luck posted a patch removing normal shutdown logs from the new “persistent store” (pstore), to avoid cluttering up limited storage. Seiji Aguchi considered it useful to retain normal shutdown logs for Enterprise use. Artem Bityutskiy and Americo Wang considered this policy in kernel and offered a mount option as the preferred solution to deciding logging action.</p>\n<p>* Sarah Sharp noticed that PCI hotplug wasn’t working properly on 2.6.38 for her particular setup. Rafael J. Wysocki pointed out a stable-bound patch, which Sarah tested and soon found PCI hotplug working again.</p>\n<p>* Dave Chinner posted some “vfs: inode lock breakup” patches, which are “derived from Nick Piggin’s vfs-scale tree”. He has been “sitting on them until the dache_lock breakup and rcu path-walk has had some time to be shaken out”. He forward ported the patches and ran some XFS/ext4 tests.</p>\n<p>* Paul Turner posted version 5 of his CFS Bandwith Control patch series.</p>\n<p>* Herbert Poetzl inquired about “debugging a modern laptop …”, which Andi Kleen replied to. In his reply, Andi pointed out the existance of the USB DebugPort, which is an optional feature built-in to many EHCI controllers. There’s usually only one, and it requires a $100 cable, but this is something this author has not played with and suspects many others haven’t either. An investment of $100 isn’t bad if you need to routinely debug laptop kernels. Mark Lord added that those with ExpressCard slots could pick up an “Oxford Chipset” card, which provides true serial/parallel ports, the latter of which can also be used for homebrew JTAG adapters (according to Mark).</p>\n<p>* Kamezawa Hiroyuki posted an RFC patch entitled “A forkbomb killer and mm tracking system”, which is all new compared with older posts, and apparently includes support for dead process tracking (struct mm_struct tracking).</p>\n<p>* Tejun Heo was cleaning up the custom locking in btrfs, migrating to standard kernel mutex adaptive spinlocks. He noted that mutex_trylock doesn’t currently do adaptive spinning, but that it probably should in his benchmarks (and that btrfs equivalent code was already doing this). Linus thought this sounded reasonable, and Tejun updated his patches accordingly.</p>\n<p>* The Microsoft HyperV folks posted a few staging cleanups.</p>\n<p>* Thomas Gleixner posted some final ARM genirq cleanups.</p>\n<p>* David Miller posted some Networking, and SPARC cleanups.</p>\n<p>* Rafael J. Wysocki requested Linus pull some more power management updates.</p>\n<p>* Jonathan Corbet posted some documentation updates.</p>\n<p>* Jens Axboe requested Linus pull some block driver updates.</p>\n<p>* Tony Lindgren requested Linus pull some OMAP fixes.</p>\n<p>* Guenter Roeck requested Linus pull some hwmon fixes.</p>\n<p>* Liam Girdwood requested Linus pull some voltage regulator updates.</p>\n<p>In today’s announcements:</p>\n<p>* Christian Dietrich announced “undertaker” version 1.1. This is another static code analysis tool for C code that users preprocessor directives. It’s part of work done by the VAMOS team at the University of Erlangen.</p>\n<p>* Scott James Remnant announced the release of version 1.2 of “Upstart”, the premier legacy init replacement daemon for Linux systems. In this release, Scott corrects a “brown paper bag” bug that broke use of pdksh.</p>\n<p>* John Linn requested that Stephen Rothwell include the new Xilinx ARM tree in linux-next.</p>\n<p>* Junio C. Hamano announced the releast of Git 1.7.4.2. It includes lots of fixes, even half hour GMT timezone offset support in gitweb.</p>\n<p>The latest kernel release is 2.6.38.</p>\n<p>Greg Kroah-Hartman announced the release of stable kernel 2.6.33.8, which is intended for use by the pre-empt RT kernel patch, which is still 2.6.33 based.</p>\n<p>Greg Kroah-Hartman announced the release of stable kernels 2.6.32.34, 2.6.38.1, and 2.6.37.5. Later, Greg posted 2.6.32.35, which had only a build fix for those bitten with a particular build problem on 2.6.32.34.</p>\n<p>Tony Luck requested Linus pull some IA64 changes.</p>\n<p>Greg Kroah-Hartman requested Linus pull some USB changes for problems reported so far during the 2.6.39 merge window.</p>\n<p>Paul Mundt requested Linus pull part two of super-H updates and some rmobile updates.</p>\n<p>John Linville posted some further wireless fixes for 2.6.39 to Dave Miller.</p>\n<p>David Howells requested Linus pull some NOMMU and FRV patches.</p>\n<p>Con Kolivas announced the release of 2.6.38-ck1, which includes various patches of his intended to “improve system responsiveness”.</p>\n<p>That’s a summary of the past week’s Linux Kernel Mailing List traffic, for further information visit www.kernel.org. I’m Jon Masters.</p>\n<p>Finally this week, Lukasz Sokol noted that the UK branch of WalMart is selling a very tux-like product, wondering if this was a legal issue. Alan Cox responded that Larry Ewing was “sort of CC-BY”, requiring attribution if asked, so that was probably ok. But more worrying to Alan was “the unfortunate placing of the stick which means it looks like its taking a crap”.</p>\n<p><br>\n\n</p><div> <a

      "content" : "<p>\nYes, I'm not kidding!\n</p>\n<p>\nIn recent months, I've been writing quite a bit of GSM MAP (Mobile Application\nPart) code.  MAP is the protocol used heavily in the GSM core network and\nespecially on the roaming interfaces between different operators.  It is\nspecified in <a href=\"http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/html-info/0902.htm\">GSM TS 09.02</a> and later <a href=\"http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/html-info/29002.htm\">3GPP TS 29.002</a>.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe protocol specification relies on <a href=\"https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Abstract_Syntax_Notation_One\">ASN.1</a> description of the messages as well\nas the regular BER encoding rules.  ASN.1 is this marvelous technology that\nallows a protocol to be specified in an abstract and formal notation, in an\nextensible way, removing all the problems of human-written marshalling code,\nfull of errors and differences due to different developers interpreting a\nhuman-readable specification in different ways.\n</p>\n<p>\nSo far so good. You think it should be simple to write a parser and generator\nfor MAP messages: Simply feed them into the ASN.1 compiler of your choice, it\nwill generate code in the target language you require.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs long as both sides of the communication do that using exactly the same\nrevision of the specification (and don't make implementation mistakes), this\nwill work.  The reality looks very different, though :(  When I test my code\nagainst something like one million of real-world messages captured on a\nproduction SS7 roaming interface, it produces errors already on packet number\nsix of that trace.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe problem is: The protocol designers have not specified the first versions\nin a really extensible way, i.e. a given operation originally only returned\none atomic data field, and it was later extended to return a sequence of data\nfields.  Thus, there is one additional level of hierarchy in the encoding.\n</p>\n<p>\nNot only that, but in their infinite wisdom, the designers of MAP have also\nfailed to include versioning information in each and every message header.\nInstead, it is part of the <i>application context name</i>, which is only\npart of the first message of every conversation.\n</p>\n<p>\nFurthermore, different versions of the MAP specifications disagree on\nwhether certain fields are deemed optional or not.  This is further\ncomplicated by somewhat strange versioning habits.  There is the Revision\nnumber of the TS 09.02 (like 3.8.10), then there is a different version\nnumber encoded in the corresponding ASN.1 files like 'version9(9)' and\nindividual operations then have v1/v2/v3 in their application context\nname.\n</p>\n<p>\nSome even more wiser decision must have been to remove the description\nof older messages from the later versions of the specifications.  So even\nspecifications published in the year 2000 no longer include definitions of\nmessages that were still part 5 years earlier.  Why does it matter? Because\ntoday, in 2011, you still see MAP message on the international SS7 interfaces\nthat are encoded in some of the earliest versions of the MAP protocol!\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd if all of this was not enough, the biggest bummer is: For most of\nthe releases of the specification, the ASM.1 text files are not distributed\nseparately, but they are interspersed with human-readable text in the\nactual specification documents (which can be 600 pages long, nothing you want\nto cut+paste).\n</p>\n<p>\nEven worse: If you go to the ETSI homepage and download the PDF version of old\n09.02 specs, they will actually provide a PDF with a scanned paper print-out,\ni.e. no searching and no copy+pasting.\n</p>\n<p>\nLuckily, the 3GPP has made the history of 3.8.0 and later available <a href=\"http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/09_series/09.02/\">on their FTP\nserver</a>.  But they are in MS Word for DOS format, like they were written\noriginally.  This format can not be opened by OpenOffice, and as far as I\nknow not even by any of the Windows Word versions that MS has released in\nthe last 10 years.\n</p>\n<p>\nSo what did I do?  I actually installed <a href=\"http://download.microsoft.com/download/word97win/Wd55_be/97/WIN98/EN-US/Wd55_ben.exe\">MS\nWord 5.5 for DOS</a> (provided as Freeware from Microsoft) and ran it in\nDOSEMU, to convert the specs into RTF format.  This way I can at least open\nthem and look at them in a modern text processor.</p>\n<center><img src=\"http://laforge.gnumonks.org/photos/gsm_map_word55.png\"></center>\n<p>\nBut this still does not solve the copy+paste problem.\n</p>\n<p>\nI finally found <a href=\"http://www.winfield.demon.nl\">antiword</a>, but it\nmainly focuses on Word for Windows files and only does rudimentary text\nextraction from Word for DOS files.  But hey, there is <a href=\"http://www.msxnet.org/word2rtf/formats/ffh-dosword5\">an online copy of\nchapter 16 from the File Formats Handbook</a>, apparently published by\nDr.Dobb's (who remembers them!!) at some time in the past.\n</p>\n<p>\nSo what did I do? I wrote some custom parser for those old Word/DOS files,\nwhich parses the paragraph format descriptions and tries to identify those\nsections that contain the ASN.1 code.  As they are almost the only part in the\nspecification that is enclosed with a border line on all four pages, this\nshould work pretty fine.  Early results are quite promising!\n</p>\n<p>\nMy hope is now that the ETSI stylesheets did not change too much over time,\ni.e.  that this parser will be able to extract the ASN.1 spec for all of the\nprotocol versions that I can find.  If that works, I can run them through\na validator, then pretty-print them and putt them all in one git tree in\nchronological order.  And maybe at some point in 2011, we will have the\nmarvels of an <a href=\"https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Diff\">unified diff</a> between two different MAP versions.  The strange part is: Diff was developed in the 1970ies, GSM in the late 1980ies.  They should have known about it back then, and used a revision control system like <a href=\"https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Source_Code_Control_System\">SCCS</a> to record all the changes in the specification they make.\n</p>\n<p>\nI guess this all is a glimpse how a digital archaeologist of the 22nd century\nmust feel when analyzing ancient artefacts and trying to understand what the\nheck his ancestors have been doing back then.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>UPDATE:</b> The tool can be found at <a href=\"http://cgit.osmocom.org/cgit/asn1_docextract/\">http://cgit.osmocom.org/cgit/asn1_docextract/</a>\n</p>"

In fact, the text I had for the blog yesterday was much longer, so I concentrated on the the actual code and performance and left the background, rationale and details for today.</p>\n<p>Let me quote myself from the introduction yesterday:</p>\n<blockquote><p>But I was left wondering: this is 2011, why are we still restricting ourselves to ASCII? I mean, even if you’re just writing your non-translated messages in English, you sometimes need some non-ASCII codepoints, like the “micro” sign (µ), the degree sign (°), the copyright sign (©) or even the Euro currency sign (€). I specifically added the Euro to the list because, unlike the others, it’s not part of Latin 1, so you need to use another encoding to represent it. Besides, this is 2011, the de-facto encoding for text interchange is UTF-8.</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Background: the charsets mandated by the C++ standard</h2>\n<p>The C and C++ standards talk about two charsets: the source input charset and the execution charset. The GCC manual argues that there are actually four: they add the wide-character charset (which is nowadays always UTF-16 or UCS-4, depending on how wide your wide char is) and the charset that the compiler uses internally. For my purposes here, let’s stick to the first two.</p>\n<p>The source input charset is the one your source file is encoded in. In the early days of C, when charsets were very different from one another, like EBCDIC, it was very important to get this right, or the compiler wouldn’t understand which bytes represented even a space or a newline. Today, one could write a compiler that assumed the input charset is ASCII and still get away with it. The input charset is used by the compiler when it loads your file into memory and translates it into a form that it can parse.</p>\n<p>The execution charset is the one that your strings are encoded in when the compiler writes the object files. That is, if you write a word imported into English like <tt>\"Résumé\"</tt>, the compiler needs to find a way to encode those “é”. Note that the compiler has loaded the source file into memory and converted it into some internal format before compiling, so we are assuming here that the compiler has understood that those are LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH ACUTE. How those “é” were on disk has nothing to do with how this blog is encoded.</p>\n<p>The GCC manual says that the default for the input charset is the locale’s charset, while the default for the execution charset is UTF-8. That’s not exactly true: unless you specify otherwise, GCC will output exactly the same bytes as it found in the input. You can verify this easily by trying to compile a Latin1-encoded file while on an UTF-8 locale. As expected, it works. I guess that changing that would break too many programs, so the GCC developers didn’t do it. But if you add any of the <tt>-finput-charset=</tt> ot <tt>-fexec-charset=</tt> options, even to the supposedly default ones, GCC will bail out if it finds something improperly encoded.</p>\n<p>About a week or two ago, we had this dicussion in the <a href=\"javascript:void(0);\">#qt</a> IRC channel on Freenode. This one developer wanted to know why QString used Latin 1 instead of the execution charset to decode the string literals. He also wanted to know why he couldn’t simply write <tt>\"\\u00fc\"</tt> to mean the “ü” letter. Well, the answer is actually simple and two-fold:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Qt and QString don’t know what execution charset you chose when you compiled your source code</li>\n<li>The execution charset isn’t constant: one object file can have a different charset from another object or library</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>QString today</h2>\n<p>If you look at how QString really works, you’ll see that it has some support for a changeable execution charset. When I say that it defaults to Latin 1, I am implying that it can be changed. In the <a href=\"http://doc.qt.nokia.com/latest/qstring.html\">QString documentation</a>, any functions that take a <tt>const char *</tt> refer to the <a href=\"http://doc.qt.nokia.com/latest/qstring.html#fromAscii\"><tt>QString::fromAscii()</tt></a> function. That function is actually a misnomer: it doesn’t convert necessarily from ASCII — in fact, the documentation says “Depending on the codec, it may not accept valid US-ASCII (ANSI X3.4-1986) input.”</p>\n<p>The function is called <tt>fromAscii</tt> because most source code today is written in ASCII. This function was actually introduced in Qt 3 (see <a href=\"http://doc.trolltech.com/3.3/qstring.html#fromAscii\">the docs</a>) and that was released in 2002. Back then, UTF-8 wasn’t as widespread as it is today — I remember switching to UTF-8 on my Linux desktop only in 2003. That meant that any file with non-ASCII bytes had a high chance of being misinterpreted when sent to someone across the world, but a low chance if you sent it to a colleague in the same country.</p>\n<p>So small teams developing applications sometimes wanted to use those non-ASCII characters that I listed in the introduction: the degree symbol, the copyright symbol, etc. And to accommodate them, QString allows you to change the codec that it uses to decode the string literals.</p>\n<p>In other words, the <tt><a href=\"http://doc.qt.nokia.com/latest/qtextcodec.html#setCodecForCStrings\">QTextCodec::setCodecForCStrings</a></tt> allows you to tell Qt what your execution charset is (problem #1 above). There’s however nothing to help you with problem #2, so libraries have to stick to telling Qt in each function what codec their strings are in.</p>\n<h2>Enter C++0x with a (partial) solution: Unicode literals</h2>\n<p>The next standard of the C++ language, still dubbed <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C++0x\">C++0x</a> even though we’re already in 2011, contains a new way of writing strings that ensure that they are always encoded in one of the UTF charsets: the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C++0x#New_string_literals\">new string literals</a>. So you can write code as:</p>\n<pre>\n    u8<span>&quot;I&#39;m a UTF-8 string.&quot;</span>\n    u<span>&quot;This is a UTF-16 string.&quot;</span>\n    U<span>&quot;This is a UTF-32 string.&quot;</span>\n</pre>\n<p>And on the receiving side, QString will know that the encoding is UTF-8, UTF-16 and UTF-32 respectively, without a doubt. I mean, almost: the UTF-8 encoded string results in a <tt>const char[]</tt>, which is no different from the existing string literals, so QString cannot tell one apart from the other. But the other two generate new types, respectively <tt>const char16_t[]</tt> and <tt>const char32_t[]</tt>, which we can use in overloads and perfectly decode the string.</p>\n<p>So the developer from IRC could write without fear <tt>u<span>&quot;\\u00fc&quot;</span></tt> and be assured that QString would decode it as LATIN SMALL LETTER U WITH DIAERESIS (U+00FC).</p>\n<p>My criticism of the C++0x committee is that they solved the problem only partially. I want to write <tt>u<span>&quot;Résumé&quot;</span></tt> and send my file to a colleague using a different platform (like Windows). Moreover, I’d like his compiler to interpret my source code exactly as <strong>I</strong> intended. Of course, that means I’m going to encode my source file as UTF-8, so I’d like every single compiler to use UTF-8 as their source input charset.</p>\n<p>The C++0x committee did not mandate that, nor did they include a way for me to mark my source file in such a way. The decoding of the source file really depends on the compiler’s settings…</p>\n<h2>My preferred solution</h2>\n<p>In absence of being able to tell the compiler what my source code charset is, I’d settle for an efficient way of creating QStrings. Internally, QStrings store data as UTF-16 and that is not going to change. So we need to get the compiler to convert the source code literal to UTF-16. Using the C++0x new string literals, we can. And since those strings are in read-only memory that can never be unloaded, we can even do:</p>\n<pre>\n    QString s = QString::fromRawData(u<span>&quot;Résumé&quot;</span>);</pre>\n<p>Ok, so we can’t write “é” as the compiler could mis-interpret it, so we might have to settle for:</p>\n<pre>\n    QString s = QString::fromRawData(u<span>&quot;R\\u00e9sum\\u00e9&quot;</span>);</pre>\n<p>Which is still a bit too verbose for my taste. Yesterday, in my blog, someone <a href=\"http://labs.qt.nokia.com/2011/03/25/qstrings-and-unicode-optimising-qstringfromutf8/#comment-20234\">suggested</a> using macros to do the above. But if we use another feature of C++0x, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C++0x#User-defined_literals\">User-defined literals</a> (see also the <a href=\"http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2008/n2765.pdf\">definition</a>), we could define the following operator:</p>\n<pre>\nQString <b>operator</b> <span>&quot;&quot;</span> q(<span>const</span> <span>char16_t</span> *str, <span>size_t</span> len);\n</pre>\n<p>Which would allow me to write:</p>\n<pre>\n    QString s = u<span>&quot;Résumé&quot;</span>q;\n</pre>\n<p>which looks weird, but is at least very clean. Unfortunately, the <a href=\"http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.6/changes.html\">latest release of GCC</a> as of today hasn’t <a href=\"http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.6/cxx0x_status.html\">implemented</a> it yet.</p>\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> A friend reminds me that Herb Sutter has reported in <a href=\"http://herbsutter.com/2011/03/25/we-have-fdis-trip-report-march-2011-c-standards-meeting/\">his blog</a> that the March 2011 meeting of the C++ standards committee has approved the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Organization_for_Standardization#Standardization_process\">Final Draft International Standard</a> for the C++ language. It should be voted in the Summer and become known as C++ 2011.</p>"

Initially, I've just \"got it to build\" with a few too many things nobbled and disabled - the results (using the package from Squeeze) are in <a href=\"http://www.emdebian.org/trac/browser/current/emdebian/trunk/qt4-embedded/tags\">Emdebian SVN</a> - and the next task is to enable the missing bits and get closer to the standard Qt4-X11 binaries. Certain packages will simply not exist, even when finished, but it's been fun working out how to create a <tt>qmake.conf</tt> to map the Emdebian toolchain to what Qt expects from toolchains like CodeSourcery.<br>\n<br>\nIf it continues to work, it may be worth pushing upstream - but it may be better to wait until Multi-Arch supports cross-building, I'd only have to submit a different qmake.conf with updated paths otherwise.<br>\n<br>\nI've also got <a href=\"http://www.emdebian.org/qmake.conf.html\">a basic qmake.conf to help Qt applications cross-build using the Emdebian toolchains</a>.  This also needs updating once we finally get Multi-Arch-Cross.<br>\n<br>\nThe way I see this working is that the Qt Embedded packages would have to kept entirely separate from the Debian Qt4-X11 binaries from the KDE/Qt team because they use the same package names. That's relatively simple if the embedded packages are kept for cross-building only, either as -armel-cross packages generated by dpkg-cross or (eventually) as Multi-Arch packages. What won't work is having Qt-X11 and Qt-Embedded installed on the same architecture, without using a chroot or similar.<br>\n<br>\nInitially, I hoped to keep the changes small enough that the Debian package could include the tweaks in a conditional part of <tt>debian/rules</tt> via a DEB_BUILD_OPTION. The current diff is a little too awkward (mainly in the .install files) but that's still worth keeping as a goal.<br>\n<br>\nNo warranty, created in the hope it's useful etc. etc., nothing to say it'll build on your system, no support for anything except the Debian armel port and only tested with the Emdebian toolchains from Lenny, <b>not</b> coming to a distribution near you anytime soon, don't blame me if it messes up your entire Qt-X11 installation on your desktop.... yada, yada.<br>\n<br>\nIt's just a bit of tinkering really, although it would be more fun if Qt didn't take quite so many hours to build each time I want to test a change....<br>"

      "content" : "<p>Every lame blog post starts with the words “I have not blogged in a while”. So I am going to start this blog post with these words</p>\n<h2>“WOAH STUFFS HAPPENING FOLKS YOU’D BETTER BELIEVE IT!”</h2>\n<p>Ok, so now that I have your attention, here are a few things to turn your attention to:</p>\n<h3><strong>Full steam ahead on bugfixes:</strong></h3>\n<p>Ever since Feature Freeze, we’ve been full steam ahead on fixing the most annoying compiz pet peeves to make 0.9.4 ready for the mass audience (and when I say mass audience, I mean taking on the likes of those mentioned in launchpad <a href=\"https://launchpad.net/bugs/1\">bug #1</a>, because compiz is all about kicking ass and taking names)</p>\n<p>Here’s some highlights of possibly the most annoying things and most difficult things to fix that we’ve achieved:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>No more invisible windows! All windows are now tracked correctly and windows that are re-parented away from the toplevels are now no longer interfered with</li>\n<li>No more unity-window-decorator crashing! (Debugging this is fun when you don’t have access to debugging symbols since that makes the problem go away)</li>\n<li>Stacking issues are now (mostly) gone with the exception of a few here and there</li>\n<li>No more <a href=\"https://bugs.launchpad.net/unity/+bug/692463\">weird xterms</a> (legacy border support added)</li>\n<li>No more confusion between placement extents and actual input extents! There is now a new API to handle this</li>\n<li>The Grid plugin is now better than Windows 7! It actually allows you to initiate “gridding” on each side of each monitor rather than the whole screen.</li>\n<li>The switcher plugin now maintains a LIFO order rather than reversing the window list all the time</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Unity MT Grab Handles!</h3>\n<p>Casually rebranded as “<a href=\"http://codearmada.com/2011/03/24/unity-has-love-handles/\">love handles</a>“, this is a new compiz plugin which makes part of the unity/compiz experience. Basically they are small input windows which act as “handles” on the side of each window brought up by a three finger tap and tapped and dragged by one finger. So awesome. Actually, I love this plugin because it is one of the most beautiful pieces of Model-View code I have ever written, and thanks to Jason Smith for hooking it up to UTouch for me!</p>\n<div><a href=\"http://smspillaz.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/itworksbitch.png\"><img title=\"Love handles\" src=\"http://smspillaz.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/itworksbitch.png?w=640&amp;h=400\" alt=\"Love handles\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></a><p>Love handles</p></div>\n<p>And finally, XTerms that don’t suck. Actually I just want to brag about this since it’s 3AM and this is one of the most annoying bugs I’ve dealt with:</p>\n<div><a href=\"http://smspillaz.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/winning-xterm.png\"><img title=\"Xterms that are winning\" src=\"http://smspillaz.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/winning-xterm.png?w=640&amp;h=200\" alt=\"Xterms that are winning\" width=\"640\" height=\"200\"></a><p>Winning</p></div>\n<p>A fun game to play now would be “spot the difference” with that xterm and what your xterms look like right now when running Natty Alpha 3. If you happen to notice the small artefact the congratulations, that miscalculation was causing all kinds of havoc and driving me nuts for the past 4 hours.</p>\n<p>That’s all for now. Out.</p>\n<br>  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/smspillaz.wordpress.com/769/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/smspillaz.wordpress.com/769/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/smspillaz.wordpress.com/769/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/delicious/smspillaz.wordpress.com/769/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gofacebook/smspillaz.wordpress.com/769/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/facebook/smspillaz.wordpress.com/769/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gotwitter/smspillaz.wordpress.com/769/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/twitter/smspillaz.wordpress.com/769/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/smspillaz.wordpress.com/769/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/stumble/smspillaz.wordpress.com/769/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/smspillaz.wordpress.com/769/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/digg/smspillaz.wordpress.com/769/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/smspillaz.wordpress.com/769/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/reddit/smspillaz.wordpress.com/769/\"></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=smspillaz.wordpress.com&amp;blog=1094742&amp;post=769&amp;subd=smspillaz&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><div></div>"

It's probably noteworthy that the FSF (who, you know, wrote the license and all) disagree with this interpretation, as do the kernel copyright holders (who, you know, wrote the code that the license covers) I've talked to about it. Anyway, after a pile of screaming and shouting from all sides HTC have tended to release their source code in a timely manner. So things seemed better.<br><br>HTC released the <a href=\"http://www.htc.com/us/products/thunderbolt-verizon\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thunderbolt</a> last week and we're back to the 90-120 day song and dance. It's probably worth remembering that by behaving in this way HTC gain a competitive advantage over any vendors who obey the terms of their license - HTC can incorporate improvements made by others without releasing their own until through a significant portion of the lifecycle of their phone.<br><br>As far as I'm concerned, every single Thunderbolt sold so far embodies a copyright infringement. Wilfully engaging in copyright infringement for commercial benefit is typically frowned upon by courts, especially if by doing so a foreign company is gaining commercial advantage over a domestic one. If you think Microsoft's patent assault on Android is a problem, just imagine what they could do if they hired one significant Linux kernel developer and used their copyrights to attack the overwhelming majority of Android vendors who fail to comply with the GPL. It probably wouldn't be industry ending (companies would merely have improve their compliance procedures) but it'd do a huge deal of damage in the short term. It's insane for companies to behave this way. Don't reward them by giving them your money.<br><br>I'll be talking about this at the Linux Foundation Collaboration Summit next month, along with an update on my study of the compliance of Android tablets. I'm hoping that there'll be further developments after that.<br><br><div style=\"text-align:right\"><font size=\"-2\">(<b><a href=\"http://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/1764.html#comments\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"comment count unavailable\" height=\"12\" src=\"http://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=mjg59&amp;ditemid=1764\" style=\"vertical-align:middle\" width=\"30\"> Comments</a></b> |<a href=\"http://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/1764.html?mode=reply\" rel=\"nofollow\">Comment on this</a>)</font></div>"

When I saw how Elon made a special point to showcase cubicles in his <a href=\"http://spacex.com/multimedia/videos.php?id=27\">recruitment videos</a>, it deeply shocked me. I thought, you have to be a moron to want to work for that guy, because you could never accomplish anything. However, SpaceX manifestly accomplished something: the first privately orbited and returned spacecraft. Being a Russian-American space nut I am also aware that their Falcon badly upstaged a massive Russian effort Angara: they built a similar or same rocket 3 times faster, with 5 times fewer people, for 10 times less money, and Falcon actually works right now, while Angara only made a few tests (e.g. KSLV-1). So, people in Elon's cubicles think good thoughts... But how do they do that?!</p>"

Ubuntu</a><br>\n</span><br>\nIt looks like 2011 started well for Debian. The project won awards in two out of seven categories at the <a href=\"http://www.debian.org/News/2011/20110304\">Linux New Media Awards 2011</a> (“Best Open Source Server Distribution” and “Outstanding Contribution to Open Source/Linux/Free Software”). Just recently Internet.com declared Debian the <a href=\"http://itmanagement.earthweb.com/osrc/article.php/3926941/Linux-Leaders-Debian-and-Ubuntu-Derivative-Distros.htm\">most influential distribution ever</a>, stating that “~63% of all distributions now being developed come ultimately from Debian.”</p>\n<p>However, my intention for this article is not solely to praise Debian for its recent awards, but rather to focus on a new project, Debian CUT. Don’t be surprised if you haven’t heard about CUT; it seems most Debian community <a href=\"http://www.debian-administration.org/polls/150\">hasn’t either</a>. Then again, maybe it’s because it is only labelled as unofficial/development so far.</p>\n</div>\n<p><strong>A bit of history</strong></p>\n<p>One of the greatest criticisms of Debian is that its release cycles are too long. Debian stable release is seen as often as Ubuntu’s LTS release. As a server solution this doesn’t present a problem at all, it can even seen as a pro. However, for desktop use and for your average Joe who needs to have the latest software and is unable to get it, this may well present a problem. Of course he can always turn to <a href=\"http://backports.debian.org/\">backports</a> to get what he needs but by the time you have finished reading this very sentence, Joe has already moved to Ubuntu.</p>\n<p>For those who are completely unaware how things work within Debian, let me try to shed some light.</p>\n<p>Debian has 3 main branches:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>stable</li>\n<li>testing</li>\n<li>unstable</li>\n</ul>\n<p>“Unstable”, is a branch used mainly by developers, where the latest changes to the software they are working on are made. Usually, after approximately 10 days this software is pushed to “testing”, branch which is going to become next Debian stable release.</p>\n<p>For comparison, in the process of a new Ubuntu release at one point in this process, changes from <em>testing/unstable </em>are frozen where Ubuntu fixes bugs until they are ready to release new Ubuntu release. Debian’s “<em>testing</em>” branch is said by some to be more stable then most of the “<em>stable</em>” distributions out there. Last but not least is “<em>stable</em>” branch, which follows the (in)famous mantra “it’s released when it’s ready”, although last two releases have been released in a more timely manner.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://foolcontrol.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/debian-coffee-cut-edit.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox[1245]\"><img src=\"http://foolcontrol.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/debian-coffee-cut-edit.jpg\" title=\"debian coffee - cut edit\" height=\"330\" width=\"570\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><strong>Okay, so what is Debian CUT?</strong></p>\n<p>The idea stretches back more then 2 years, to Joey Hess proposing the idea of “<a href=\"http://kitenet.net/~joey/code/debian/cut/\">Constantly Usable Testing</a>“. For users/developers who can’t wait ~2 years to see new Debian release, they usually turn to Debian “testing” branch. To clarify, “testing” images are released <a href=\"http://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/weekly-builds/\">weekly</a>, but most of us in Debian don’t recommend you jump to “testing” by installing it from weekly image, but rather by upgrading from stable. To make the situation even worse, these builds frequently don’t work due to all the changes that have been pushed from unstable.</p>\n<p>But this is where <strong>C</strong>onstantly <strong>U</strong>sable <strong>T</strong>esting idea comes in, where the installer is always installable and you’re already using what’s going to be next stable release. You wouldn’t have to worry about whether the next update is going to break your system, but would get regular security updates, while the big updates would come in shape of new testing snapshot versions. Frequency of release of these snapshots is ought to be on monthly basis, so you can plan on seeing the next release on April 6th (exactly one month after the current release, provided of course if there are no showstopper bugs).</p>\n<p>To sum it all up, you wouldn’t have to wait ~2 years before new Stable release shows up, nor (in case you have already switched to testing) would you have to worry whether your next update will break your system. You would get your updates in form of timely (ie: monthly) snapshots until it’s time for major milestone which would turn out to be new Debian release. Even though this might be long term goal, in these early stages no one can guarantees this.</p>\n<p><strong>Rolling release? </strong></p>\n<p>The simplest way to explain this concept is that there are two types of Linux distributions: one with milestone version numbers and other where new updates keep coming through their rolling release cycles. Some of the rolling distributions are Gentoo and Arch Linux, while on the other side you have RedHat and Suse. Novell announced that OpenSuse is moving to rolling release with project codename Tumbleweed. It’s also worth mentioning that Debian already has its rolling counters and perfect examples are: <a href=\"http://www.linuxmint.com/download_lmde.php\">LMDE</a> and <a href=\"http://aptosid.com/\">aptosid</a>.</p>\n<p>It is a way to continuously develop software, a way that best fits Debian as a platform where software is continuously developed. Especially because most of its greatest values could get lost with the release of that big stable “version”. Perfect case of that could be the almost drop of <a href=\"http://lwn.net/Articles/404050/\">Chromium in Squeeze</a>.</p>\n<p>Another great example could be Android, which is criticised most for its versioning. Companies are refusing to release new Android versions to their current phones, because they want you to buy new phone with latest Android version, even though your current one is perfectly capable of running latest Android.</p>\n<p>Personally, I’m sure the future will reveal that rolling releases are the future, towards which all Linux platforms should be heading. Perhaps the definition of rolling releases I gave earlier is why I believe this project has such bright future ahead of it. Debian would be somewhat of a hybrid of this definition, it would be rolling release until it’s time to mark a big milestone with a version number, and before you know it, we’re rolling again.</p>\n<p><strong>Unofficial Debian Monthly Testing Snapshot Release (version 2011.03 final)</strong></p>\n<p>Michael Gilbert took on a big responsibility, trying experimentally to prove the feasibility of such a project. He has released a first wheezy snapshot installer (versioned 2011.03) as a test for the development community to try out and evaluate. <a href=\"http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2011/03/msg00347.html\">Please read official announcement along with download links</a>. While you can use this snapshot to have constantly working installer, after it is installed you could move to testing altogether if you wish.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p>As I have already mentioned, this project is still in the development/experimental stage, which makes all of this its very conception. Also, apart from <a href=\"http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2010/11/ubuntu-to-become-a-rolling-release-distro/\">rumors of Ubuntu becoming rolling release</a>, if Ubuntu is to get its rolling release this how it’s going to get it <img src=\"http://foolcontrol.org/wp-content/plugins/tango-smileys-extended/tango/smile.png\" alt=\"Smile\" title=\"Smile\"></p>\n<p>If you’d like to find out more about Debian CUT, I suggest you read <a href=\"http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/author/rhertzog/\">Raphael Hertzog</a>’s article “<a href=\"http://lwn.net/Articles/406301/\">A constantly usable testing distribution for Debian</a>”, and watch the video of Joey Hess <a href=\"http://meetings-archive.debian.net/pub/debian-meetings/2010/debconf10/high/1359_1359_CUT_BoF.ogv\">CUT BoF on DebConf10</a> in NYC.</p>\n<p>Of course, if you’d like to get involved into this project, please use the <a href=\"http://lists.alioth.debian.org/mailman/listinfo/cut-team\">project’s mailing list</a>. If you have any comments, please do share, as I’d be happy to answer any of your questions.</p>"

      "content" : "<p></p><p>Lighthouse is the Window System Agnostic port of QtGui. What that means is that QtGui doesn’t know what windowing system it runs on, but pushes that logic into plugins.</p>\n<p>A missing feature of Lighthouse up until now was that we didn’t provide a multi-process solutions where you had Qt running on both the server side and the client side (like we had in QWS). You could write such a thing yourself, of course: Marius designed a protocol when he was creating his <a href=\"http://labs.qt.nokia.com/2010/02/10/a-lighthouse-with-windows/\">windowing system</a> for his DevDays presentation. However, Paul and I both agreed on that we didn’t want to create or maintain a protocol. One of the lessons from QWS is that making a multiprocess Window System protocol is difficult. QWS didn’t really have a formal protocol, but rather something that just happened. This also resulted in the QWS server and client being very closely tied.</p>\n<p>It would be nice if someone out there was just making a protocol that we could use. It turns out that the Wayland project is just that! Its a specification for a multiprocess windowing system. The Wayland client and server libraries gives means for communicating between server and client, but it does not interfere with what is being drawn, or how it is being composited. The server in Wayland is a compositing window manager, or “compositor” for short. For a deeper insight into Wayland, check out their homepage at: <a href=\"http://wayland.freedesktop.org/\">http://wayland.freedesktop.org/</a></p>\n<p>For the last couple of months, Paul, Samuel and I have been getting our hands dirty with Wayland. What became apparent to us quite quickly is that there is not going to be one compositor to rule them all! An embedded device with a small screen has very different requirements from the Linux desktop. However, we would like many of them to be Qt compositors. We have therefore created a new labs project called <a title=\"Qt-Compositor\" href=\"http://qt.gitorious.org/qt-labs/qt-compositor\">Qt-Compositor</a>. The goal of the project is to work as a tool box which is being used as a base layer for other people when they are going to write their own custom Wayland compositors.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://labs.qt.nokia.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Qt-Compositor.png\"><img title=\"Qt-Compositor\" src=\"http://labs.qt.nokia.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Qt-Compositor.png\" alt=\"Overview\" width=\"445\" height=\"517\"></a>Here is a simple diagram that I made which tries to show the intended architecture. The lighthouse plugin which runs on the screen will control mode-setting etc. The display information is available in the Qt-Compositor and Custom Compositor levels through Qt apis and Lighthouse apis.</p>\n<p>Qt-Compositor abstracts away all communication needed by a Wayland compositor. Hence the primary task for someone who implements a custom compositor is how the surfaces will be drawn.</p>\n<p>On the client side, the display information is sent over the protocol, and is available to all clients through the usual Qt-APIs.</p>\n<p>What I think is exciting about this is that this setup is that a compositor can be made with utilizing any painting technology which is in Qt!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you want to compose them using QPainter on a QWidget: “SURE! why not. knock yourself out:)”</li>\n<li>If you want to compose them using QGraphicsView: “Hey! whats that scrollarea doing there:)</li>\n<li>If you want to compose surfaces using the up and coming Qt – Quick scene graph project: “oooh, that is interesting!”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A few days ago, Samuel made this super cool example compositor using qml scene graph. Its not a full featured compositor, but it shows some pretty cool features, like how to integrate Qt-Compositor with qml and how to easily write shaders for your surfaces.</p>\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"http://labs.qt.nokia.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/waylandscreenshot.png\"><img title=\"waylandscreenshot\" src=\"http://labs.qt.nokia.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/waylandscreenshot.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"616\" height=\"483\"></a>\n\t<p>The Qml-Compositor example</p>\n</div>"

With only a 20-line patch to CUPS, workstations would be able to find which printers are on the same location. 20 lines of code, instead of a complex virtualisation solution? This is exactly the kind of reasons why we use free software: when there’s something wrong, you can fix it. When you need something more, you can code it.</p>\n\n<p>Now, many others could benefit of such an improvement, and we don’t want to maintain a forked version of CUPS, so we forwarded it upstream, who looked interested. But upstream now being Apple, they requested a stupid <a href=\"http://www.cups.org/AppleContributorAgreement_2011-03-10.pdf\">copyright assignment agreement</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I will leave to the reader’s imagination the complexity of getting such a document signed in a Fortune 500 company with no business with Apple. This will, of course, not happen - and if the decision was mine, the answer would have been a clear “No.” No, because I want to improve free software, not to contribute to Apple’s proprietary version. No, because copyleft is about giving as much as you take.</p>\n\n<p>How many contributions are being left out of CUPS because of this stupid copyright assignment? It looks to me that such software is doomed to remain crippled as long as companies like Apple are in charge of their maintenance.</p>\n\n<p>There is free software. And there is free software by Apple. And Oracle. And <a href=\"http://lwn.net/Articles/359013/\">Canonical</a>.</p>"

Unfortunately, this is highly explosive. So the best\nthey can do is to try to get the gas out of the core containment, and let is explode outside where it does not cause too much radioactive\npollusion (are core explosion would be really bad). This already happened at\nreactors 1 and 3, and will happen at reactor 2 the next one or two days.</li>\n<li>They use the sea water to slow down the core meltdown and keep the core\ncontainment stable. They probably do this by flooding the second containment,\nwhere there it no direct radioactive materials.</li>\n</ul></div>\n<div>So essentially, I don't see much of a risk of a <em>nuclear</em>\nexplosion, and I expect the radioactive pollution to be quite low, mostly via\nindirect radiation from the coolant in the outer containment. The reactor\nhowever is trashed and full of highly radioactive waste, that will require\nconstant cooling for the next few years.</div>\n<div>However, I'm really concerned that <b>apparently, the government and the\ncompanies involed <em>lied</em> to us</b>. This is happening a lot when it\ncomes to nuclear power, they barely are truthful about what is happening.</div>\n<div><b>Nuclear power is only safe as long it is operated by\n<em>altruistic and responsible</em> people.  Once you bring free market,\npolitics and money in, it is a dangerous toy that should <em>not</em> be toyed\nwith by humans.</b></div>"

Winnie’s article gives an example of a school shutting a program because of getting new teachers who lacked computer skills and some examples of schools which had issues with the repair cost. The solution to that would be computers that are more robust and easier to use – by all accounts the OLPC systems are solidly constructed and easy to use!</p><p>It is claimed that using laptops doesn’t increase test scores. Using only test scores to compare educational methods is a way to lose, probably any school which does nothing other than try to increase test scores is worth avoiding. One example from Winnie’s article is a report by Mr. Warschauer of “<i>students at a middle school in Yarmouth, Me., who used their laptops to create a Spanish book for poor children in Guatemala and debate Supreme Court cases found online</i>“. What value can you place on having students develop books for poor children in other countries and debate Supreme Court cases? If this sort of program became popular then it would lead to the countries which do it becoming better places to live in future decades!</p><p>Mr. Warschauer also claims that “<i>If the goal is to get kids up to basic standard levels, then maybe laptops are not the tool. But if the goal is to create the George Lucas and Steve Jobs of the future, then laptops are extremely useful</i>“. I would go further than that, I think that providing the educational environment that involves international charity work and analysis of important court cases would lead to students having the skills to become good engineers, designers, and artists who work for people like George Lucas and Steve Jobs. No matter what you might do the vast majority of children will not grow up to be like George Lucas and Steve Jobs, there is a very limited number of positions for such people. But those people employ a huge number of creative people who do interesting and enjoyable work for good pay.</p><p>I don’t think that Winnie’s article supports criticism of the OLPC project. I don’t think that Winnie’s article even contains sufficient evidence to match the headline.</p><h3>Playing Games</h3><p>Sam also <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/11/business/11digi.html?adxnnl=1\">cites an article about the misuse of school computers for playing games [3]</a>. Of course there are ways of limiting access to games based on time etc. For a Linux system you could have a root cron job that runs chmod on /usr/games at various times, and preventing users from easily running programs that they install isn’t difficult.</p><p>Not that games are all bad, the flash-based games on <a href=\"http://www.physicsgames.net/\">www.physicsgames.net</a> do teach kids some things about physics – although I admit that much of that could be learned by playing with balls, skate-boards, etc.</p><h3>The Problem with the OLPC Project</h3><p>I think that the policy change to make OLPC systems only available to disadvantaged children was a mistake. The “give one get one” program was a great idea, maybe not the most effective way of getting funding but good for getting developers. While the new <a href=\"http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Sugar_on_a_Stick\">Sugar on a Stick project to put the OLPC GUI on a bootable USB device [4]</a> it doesn’t compare well to having dedicated hardware IMHO.</p><h3>Minimal Use of Computers</h3><p><a href=\"http://etbe.coker.com.au/2008/05/24/school-bag-weight/\">I have previously written about the weight of school bags and how laptops can alleviate the risk of health problems related to carrying heavy text books [5]</a>. Since that time ebook readers and tablets have become incredibly cheap. Ebook readers are really light and the recent tablets are also very light (particularly the smaller ones). It seems to me that every school should at least be moving towards every student having an ebook reader and to use ebooks for all books that are part of the curriculum.</p><p>At the moment there are a bunch of tablets on sale for about $150, that includes tablets that can access the Internet via Wifi or via 3G – and a cheap 3G plan costs less than $150 per annum. If tablets were used for some of the computer tasks related to schools then a lot of the difficulty of repairing hardware would be removed. Tablets don’t offer as many options for messing up the software configuration and if the hardware breaks it’s easy to transfer the data onto a new tablet from the cloud – with a maximum cost of $150 to replace the hardware.</p><p>Also a cloud-based computing model could permit students to access all the same data from school and home while using desktop computers at both locations.</p><h3>Current Success</h3><p><a href=\"http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/autistic-kids-learn-to-fly-in-cyberspace-20110219-1b0fj.html\">Natalie Craig wrote an interesting article for The Age about “The Lab” – a drop-in computer center for kids on the Autism Spectrum run by Dale Linegar and Stefan Schutt [6]</a>. The fact that kids who have communication difficulties can find it easier to communicate electronically should be fairly obvious to everyone in the free software community, but the creation of an organisation to support such kids is noteworthy – I think that such centers should be funded by the government and run in every city.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/salman_khan_let_s_use_video_to_reinvent_education.html\">Salman Khan gave an interesting TED talk about his project the Khan Academy [7]</a> which is an online video-based teaching system that evolved from some Youtube videos he produced to tutor his cousins. Salman pointed out that his cousins said that they would rather watch his videos than have him teach them in person, it seems that they liked being able to pause and rewind the talk as well as avoiding the pressure of human interaction. <a href=\"http://www.khanacademy.org/\">The Khan Academy has videos in Adobe flash format, but conveniently they have download links so those of us who don’t have the Flash plugin can still view the content [8]</a>.</p><p>One of the interesting things about the Khan Academy is that in school use the videos are being assigned to kids as homework and the class time is used for teaching children to do worked examples – what has traditionally been homework.</p><p>So it seems that there are real examples of special-needs kids and average kids benefiting from different types of electronic learning.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>I think that almost everything about the education system is broken. I also think that in many ways the education system has reached a local maximum, so there is no small way of improving things, and adding computers without making any of the significant changes needed to fix the big problems probably can’t do a lot of good. In spite of this computers can provide some real benefits and I expect that those benefits can be better than the benefits of other potential ways of spending the money (IE it’s worth the opportunity cost). I also have no doubt that almost anything can give a negative result if done badly enough, so I don’t interpret examples of computer use failing in a school as anything other than evidence of a failing school.</p><p>While the Khan Academy has some results that seem very positive I think that’s only the first step of what needs to be done. It also seems to be based around users who have good Internet access which often isn’t the case in places where the OLPC is being deployed. This implies that we need to get systems like the Khan Academy designed to operate in a disconnected manner, maybe with a remote server that’s not connected to the Internet. This should be possible if funding is available.</p><p>Sam suggested that there needs to be a scientific study of the effectiveness of the OLPC. I think that every project which involves significant amounts of public funding should be researched to ensure that it’s an effective use of resources. 400,000 laptops is going to cost something more than $40,000,000 so it seems reasonable to devote a few person-years of research to determine how effective they are and which of the possible ways of using an OLPC will give the best results.</p><p>I am confident that a good study of the effectiveness of the OLPC would demonstrate that it provides real educational benefits when correctly incorporated into an educational program. I also expect that such a study would show some significant differences in the effectiveness of various ways of using them. But we shouldn’t be relying on confidence, we need some test results.</p><ul><li>[1]<a href=\"http://www.itwire.com/opinion-and-analysis/open-sauce/44673-lca-2011-is-the-olpc-about-technology-or-education\"> http://www.itwire.com/opinion-and-analysis/open-sauce/44673-lca-2011-is-the-olpc-about-technology-or-education</a></li><li>[2]<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/04/education/04laptop.html\"> http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/04/education/04laptop.html</a></li><li>[3]<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/11/business/11digi.html?adxnnl=1\"> http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/11/business/11digi.html?adxnnl=1</a></li><li>[4]<a href=\"http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Sugar_on_a_Stick\"> http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Sugar_on_a_Stick</a></li><li>[5]<a href=\"http://etbe.coker.com.au/2008/05/24/school-bag-weight/\"> http://etbe.coker.com.au/2008/05/24/school-bag-weight/</a></li><li>[6]<a href=\"http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/autistic-kids-learn-to-fly-in-cyberspace-20110219-1b0fj.html\"> http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/autistic-kids-learn-to-fly-in-cyberspace-20110219-1b0fj.html</a></li><li>[7]<a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/salman_khan_let_s_use_video_to_reinvent_education.html\"> http://www.ted.com/talks/salman_khan_let_s_use_video_to_reinvent_education.html</a></li><li>[8]<a href=\"http://www.khanacademy.org/\"> http://www.khanacademy.org/</a></li></ul>"

Otherwise, the slot is invoked directly, behaving as <span>Qt::DirectConnection</span>.

The Sorter class will provide a <span>sortAsync(QVector)</span> method that will be called by clients to sort a vector asynchronously. Because the operation is asynchronous, we also need to define a <span>vectorSorted(QVector)</span> signal to notify the client when the sorting is done.</div><b><br></b><br><b>Sorter class: header</b><br><pre>#include &lt;QThread&gt;<br>#include &lt;QVector&gt;<br><br>/*!
